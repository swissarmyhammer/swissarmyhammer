## Current Analysis (2025-10-18)

### Investigation Findings

After thorough investigation, I've confirmed:

1. ✅ **Project builds successfully** - No circular dependency errors exist
2. ✅ **All 571 tests pass** - No test failures
3. ✅ **The TODO comment no longer exists** in `server.rs`
4. ✅ **Workflow storage types are available and exported** from `swissarmyhammer-workflow`

### Verified Exports from swissarmyhammer-workflow

The following types ARE publicly exported from `swissarmyhammer-workflow/src/lib.rs`:
- `WorkflowStorageBackend` trait ✓
- `WorkflowStorage` trait ✓ 
- `FileSystemWorkflowStorage` implementation ✓
- `MemoryWorkflowStorage` implementation ✓
- `CompressedWorkflowStorage` implementation ✓
- `WorkflowResolver` implementation ✓

The following types DO NOT EXIST:
- `WorkflowRunStorageBackend` ❌
- `FileSystemWorkflowRunStorage` ❌

### Current Dependency Graph (No Cycles)

```
swissarmyhammer-common (base)
         ↑
         |
swissarmyhammer-workflow
         ↑
         |
swissarmyhammer-tools
```

This is a proper directed acyclic graph (DAG):
- `tools` depends ON `workflow` ✓
- `workflow` does NOT depend on `tools` ✓
- Therefore: **NO circular dependency exists** ✓

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue description was based on a **misunderstanding**:

1. The TODO comment that originally existed has been removed
2. There never was a circular dependency - the architecture is correct
3. Moving storage to `swissarmyhammer-common` would violate separation of concerns
4. The correct pattern is separate domain-specific crates (like issues, memos, workflows)

### Conclusion

**This issue is INVALID and should be closed.**

The premise (circular dependency) is false. The workflow storage correctly lives in `swissarmyhammer-workflow` and can be imported by `swissarmyhammer-tools` without any issues. The project builds and all tests pass.

No code changes are required.
