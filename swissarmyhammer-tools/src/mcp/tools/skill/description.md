You have access to skills that extend your capabilities. Skills provide specialized instructions
for specific tasks. When a user's request matches a skill's description, invoke the skill tool
with verb "use" and the skill name. The skill instructions will be returned — follow them.
Use verb "search" with a query to find skills by keyword.
Use verb "list" to see all available skills.
