   - Aggregation accuracy and performance
   - Trend calculation validation
   - Statistical analysis correctness

3. **Database Storage Integration**
   - Optional database functionality
   - Data synchronization between storage backends
   - Query accuracy and performance
   - Schema migration and integrity

4. **End-to-End Storage Workflow**
   - Complete cost data flow from capture to storage
   - Multi-backend consistency validation
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance under load

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path Testing**
   - Complete issue workflow with cost tracking
   - Cost data stored in all configured backends

## Proposed Solution

Based on analysis of the existing codebase, I will implement comprehensive storage and reporting test coverage by leveraging the existing cost tracking infrastructure and extending it with specialized integration tests.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Test Infrastructure Development**
   - Create `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/integration_tests/storage.rs` with comprehensive storage workflow tests
   - Create `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/test_utils/storage_helpers.rs` with utilities for multi-backend testing
   - Extend existing test harness to support storage backend coordination testing

2. **Storage Backend Integration Testing**
   - Build on existing `CostTracker`, `CostCalculator`, and `CostSectionFormatter` infrastructure
   - Test coordination between markdown-based storage, optional database storage, and metrics integration
   - Validate data consistency across all configured storage backends

3. **Issue Markdown Integration Testing**
   - Leverage existing `IssueStorage` trait implementations (FileSystemIssueStorage, CachedIssueStorage)
   - Test cost section generation and integration with issue completion workflow
   - Validate markdown parsing and formatting accuracy

4. **Metrics System Integration Testing**
   - Test cost data integration with existing metrics infrastructure
   - Validate aggregation accuracy and performance metrics
   - Test trend calculation and statistical analysis correctness

5. **Database Storage Testing**
   - Test optional database functionality with feature flag scenarios
   - Validate data synchronization between storage backends when database is enabled/disabled
   - Test schema migration and integrity using existing database module

6. **Error Handling and Recovery Testing**
   - Test graceful degradation when individual storage backends fail
   - Validate partial storage success scenarios
   - Test data recovery mechanisms and error logging

### Key Components to Implement

1. **StorageTestHarness**: Coordinates testing across multiple storage backends
2. **MultiBackendValidator**: Ensures data consistency across storage systems
3. **IssueWorkflowTester**: Tests end-to-end issue completion with cost tracking
4. **DatabaseToggleTester**: Tests database enable/disable scenarios
5. **PerformanceValidator**: Validates storage operation performance requirements

### Test Coverage Areas

- **End-to-End Storage Workflow**: Complete cost data flow from capture to storage across all backends
- **Configuration Integration**: Different storage backend configurations and dynamic changes
- **Error Condition Handling**: Backend failures, partial data scenarios, connection issues
- **Performance Validation**: Storage operations, query performance, memory usage under load
- **Data Consistency**: Cross-backend validation, markdown formatting accuracy, database integrity

The solution will build upon the existing robust test infrastructure while adding specialized tests for storage and reporting integration across the multi-backend system.
