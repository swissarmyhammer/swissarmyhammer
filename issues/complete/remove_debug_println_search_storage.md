# Remove Debug Print Statements from Search Storage Module

## Location
`swissarmyhammer/src/search/storage.rs:1490-1497`

## Description
Debug println statements are present in production code for error troubleshooting. These should be removed or replaced with proper logging using the `tracing` crate.

## Current State
The code contains raw `println!` statements used for debugging purposes that should not be in production code.

## Requirements
- Remove all debug `println!` statements
- Replace with proper logging using the `tracing` crate if logging is needed
- Ensure no debug output goes to stdout in production
- Follow Rust coding standards for logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All debug `println!` statements removed
- [ ] If logging is needed, `tracing` crate is used instead
- [ ] No console output in normal operation
- [ ] Appropriate log levels used (debug, trace, etc.)
- [ ] Code follows Rust best practices for error handling and logging
## Proposed Solution

Replace all debug println statements in the search storage module with proper tracing calls following the Rust coding standards.

### Analysis
Found multiple debug println statements in test functions at lines:
- 1483, 1487: Basic search result debugging
- 1520-1522, 1529-1530, 1536-1537: Full integration test error debugging  
- 1547: Searcher creation failure debugging

### Implementation Plan
1. Add `tracing` import to the module
2. Replace all `println!` debug statements with appropriate `tracing::debug!` or `tracing::error!` calls
3. Use `debug!` for successful operation logging and `error!` for failure cases
4. Preserve all test functionality while following proper logging practices

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Changes Made
1. **Added tracing import**: Added `use tracing;` to module imports
2. **Replaced debug println statements** with appropriate tracing calls:
   - Line 1483: `println!("Search succeeded with {} results", results.len())` → `tracing::debug!("Search succeeded with {} results", results.len())`
   - Line 1487: `println!("Search failed with error: {e}")` → `tracing::error!("Search failed with error: {e}")`
   - Lines 1520-1522: Success message → `tracing::debug!` call
   - Lines 1529-1530: Error messages → `tracing::error!` calls
   - Lines 1536-1537: Error chain debugging → `tracing::error!` calls
   - Line 1547: Searcher creation failure → `tracing::error!` call

### Verification Results
- ✅ All 17 search storage tests pass
- ✅ No clippy warnings or errors
- ✅ Code properly formatted with `cargo fmt`
- ✅ Only legitimate `println!` remaining is in test data (code content string)
- ✅ Proper tracing calls follow Rust coding standards

### Summary
Successfully removed all debug println statements and replaced them with appropriate tracing calls. The module now follows proper Rust logging practices using the `tracing` crate while preserving all test functionality.
