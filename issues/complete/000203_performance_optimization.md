# Performance Optimization and Overhead Minimization

## Summary

Optimize the cost tracking system to meet the performance requirements specified in the PRD: less than 50ms overhead per API call, minimal memory usage, and efficient resource management throughout the system.

## Proposed Solution

Based on analysis of the existing cost tracking implementation, I've identified the key performance bottlenecks and designed a comprehensive optimization strategy:

### Current Performance Issues Identified:

1. **Memory Management Bottlenecks:**
   - `HashMap<CostSessionId, CostSession>` with unbounded growth
   - String allocations for every token counting operation
   - No memory pooling for frequently allocated structures
   - Synchronous cleanup operations causing blocking

2. **Token Counting Performance Issues:**
   - JSON parsing on every API response (string allocation heavy)
   - No pre-compiled regex patterns or token estimation caching
   - Validation runs synchronously on each API call
   - No SIMD optimization for token counting algorithms

3. **Storage and I/O Bottlenecks:**
   - All database operations are synchronous
   - No batching of storage operations
   - Individual writes for each API call
   - No connection pooling for database access

4. **Aggregation Performance:**
   - Full recalculation on every request rather than incremental updates
   - No caching of computed statistics
   - Linear scans through all cost data
   - No parallel processing for large datasets

### Optimization Implementation Plan:

#### 1. **Memory Pool Architecture** (`performance/memory.rs`)
- Arena allocators for cost sessions and API calls
- Pre-allocated buffer pools for JSON parsing
- String interning for repeated model names and endpoints
- Background memory cleanup with configurable thresholds

#### 2. **Optimized Token Counting** (`performance/token_optimization.rs`)
- Pre-allocated parsing buffers with reuse
- SIMD-optimized token estimation algorithms
- Compiled regex patterns with caching
- Async validation pipeline with batching

#### 3. **Async Storage Pipeline** (`performance/async_storage.rs`)
- Background storage queue with batching
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Write-behind caching with configurable flush intervals
- Parallel storage operations for bulk data

#### 4. **Incremental Aggregation Engine** (`performance/aggregation.rs`)
- Streaming statistics calculation
- Cached intermediate results with TTL
- Parallel aggregation for cross-issue analysis
- Memory-mapped file access for large datasets

#### 5. **Performance Monitoring Integration** (`performance/monitoring.rs`)
- Real-time overhead measurement per API call
- Memory usage tracking with alerts
- Performance regression detection
- Configurable performance budgets

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Memory pools and async infrastructure
2. **Phase 2: Token Optimization** - SIMD algorithms and caching
3. **Phase 3: Storage Pipeline** - Async batching and connection pooling
4. **Phase 4: Aggregation Engine** - Incremental statistics and parallel processing
5. **Phase 5: Integration & Monitoring** - Performance tracking and tuning

### Performance Targets:

- Consider using SIMD instructions for token counting
- Implement memory pools for frequently allocated structures
- Use async I/O for all storage operations
- Consider different optimization strategies for different workload types
- Test performance under realistic load conditions
- Profile with realistic data sizes and patterns
- Consider trade-offs between accuracy and performance where appropriate
