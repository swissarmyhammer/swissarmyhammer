# Cross-Issue Cost Aggregation and Statistics

## Summary

Implement cross-issue cost aggregation and statistical analysis to provide project-wide cost insights, trends, and optimization recommendations across all completed issues.

## Context

Individual issue cost tracking provides valuable data, but project-wide aggregation enables broader insights like total project costs, cost trends over time, cost efficiency analysis, and optimization opportunities. This step implements comprehensive aggregation across all issues.

## Requirements

   - Total cost across all completed issues
   - Average cost per issue type
   - Cost trends over time periods
   - Cost distribution analysis

2. **Cost Trend Analysis**
   - Daily/weekly/monthly cost trends
   - Seasonal patterns and variations
   - Cost efficiency improvements over time
   - Performance correlation analysis

3. **Optimization Insights**

   - Cost efficiency recommendations
   - Token usage optimization suggestions
   - API usage pattern analysis

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Cost summary reports

   - Comparative analysis between issues
   - Export capabilities for external analysis

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Aggregation Engine**
   - Scan all completed issues for cost data
   - Parse cost sections from markdown files
   - Aggregate data from metrics system
   - Query database when available

2. **Statistical Analysis**

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- Create: `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/aggregation/`
- Add: `mod.rs`, `analyzer.rs`, `reports.rs`, `trends.rs`

### Core Components

```rust
pub struct CostAggregator {
    issue_storage: Arc<dyn IssueStorage>,
    metrics: Arc<WorkflowMetrics>,
    database: Option<Arc<CostDatabase>>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ProjectCostSummary {
    pub total_cost: Decimal,
    pub total_issues: usize,
    pub average_cost_per_issue: Decimal,
    pub cost_trend: CostTrend,
    pub efficiency_metrics: EfficiencyMetrics,
    pub period: DateRange,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CostTrend {
    pub daily_costs: Vec<(DateTime<Utc>, Decimal)>,
    pub trend_direction: TrendDirection,
    pub growth_rate: f64,
    pub confidence: f64,
}

pub enum TrendDirection {
    Increasing,
    Decreasing,
    Stable,
    Volatile,
}
```

### Aggregation Functions
- Scan completed issues directory
- Extract cost data from markdown sections
- Combine with metrics system data
- Validate data consistency

### Analysis Algorithms
- Statistical analysis (mean, median, percentiles)
- Trend calculation using regression analysis
- Outlier detection and flagging
- Efficiency metric computation

### Reporting Features
- Generate summary reports in multiple formats
- Provide data for visualization
- Support custom date ranges and filters
- Enable export to CSV/JSON formats

## Configuration Integration

Add to existing config:
```yaml
cost_tracking:
  aggregation:
    enabled: true
    scan_interval_hours: 24  # How often to update aggregations
    retention_days: 365      # How long to keep aggregated data
    trend_analysis_days: 30  # Period for trend calculation
    outlier_threshold: 2.0   # Standard deviations for outlier detection
```

## Testing Requirements

### Aggregation Testing
- Cost data aggregation accuracy
- Statistical calculation validation
- Trend analysis correctness
- Performance with large datasets

### Integration Testing
- Multi-source data aggregation
- Consistency across storage backends
- Real-time vs batch aggregation
- Configuration integration

### Performance Testing

## Integration

This step integrates with:
- Step 000198: Reads cost data from issue markdown
- Step 000199: Uses metrics system aggregation
- Step 000200: Leverages database queries when available
- All previous cost tracking components

## Use Cases

### Project Management
- Track total project costs
- Budget vs actual analysis
- Cost forecasting
- Resource allocation optimization

### Development Optimization
- Identify expensive development patterns
- Track cost efficiency improvements
- Compare different approaches
- Guide development practices

### Business Analysis

## Proposed Solution

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive cross-issue cost aggregation and analysis system with the following components:

### Implementation Overview

1. **Core Aggregation Module** (`swissarmyhammer/src/cost/aggregation/`)
   - `mod.rs` - Module definition and public API exports
   - `analyzer.rs` - Main `CostAggregator` engine for data collection and analysis
   - `trends.rs` - `TrendAnalyzer` for statistical trend analysis and predictions
   - `reports.rs` - `ReportGenerator` for multi-format report generation
   - `tests.rs` - Comprehensive test suite

2. **Data Structures Implemented**
   - `ProjectCostSummary` - Comprehensive project-wide cost analysis

- Handles large datasets (up to 10,000 issues per aggregation)
- Graceful fallback when data sources are unavailable
- Statistical outlier detection using configurable thresholds
- Cost breakdown by categories and patterns

#### Trend Analysis (`TrendAnalyzer`) 
- Linear regression analysis for trend direction classification
- Volatility calculations and stability scoring
- Seasonal pattern detection (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Cost predictions with confidence intervals
- R-squared correlation analysis for trend confidence

#### Reporting System (`ReportGenerator`)
- Multiple export formats: JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, Text
- Configurable report sections and detail levels

  - Scanning intervals and retention policies
  - Trend analysis periods and outlier thresholds
  - Data quality requirements (minimum issues for analysis)
  - Flexible time window configurations

### Architecture Benefits

- **Scalable**: Handles large numbers of issues with memory-efficient processing
- **Flexible**: Multiple data sources with graceful degradation
- **Extensible**: Plugin-ready architecture for new analysis types
- **Observable**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Testable**: Full test coverage with mock implementations

### Integration Points

- Seamlessly integrates with existing cost tracking infrastructure
- Uses established configuration patterns and error handling
- Leverages existing issue storage and workflow metrics systems
- Compatible with optional database features for enhanced analytics

### Usage Example

```rust
use swissarmyhammer::cost::{CostAggregator, AggregationConfig, DateRange, ExportFormat};

// Create aggregator with configuration
let config = AggregationConfig::default();
let aggregator = CostAggregator::new(issue_storage, metrics, database, config);

// Generate project summary
let date_range = DateRange::new(start_date, end_date);
let summary = aggregator.generate_project_summary(Some(date_range)).await?;

// Generate and export reports
let report_generator = ReportGenerator::default();
let report = report_generator.generate_report(summary, ExportFormat::Markdown)?;
let markdown_output = report_generator.export_report(&report, ExportFormat::Markdown)?;
```

This implementation fully satisfies all requirements in the issue specification and provides a robust foundation for project-wide cost analysis and optimization.
