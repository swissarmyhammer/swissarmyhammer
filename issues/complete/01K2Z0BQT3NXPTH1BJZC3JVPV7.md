review the documentation and correct it to match the changes made in this branch

## Proposed Solution

After reviewing the changes in the `parameters` branch, I need to update the documentation to reflect the major parameter system unification that has been implemented:

### Key Changes to Document:

1. **CLI Parameter Consolidation**: The CLI has been unified to use only `--var` instead of both `--set` and `--var`/`--arg`
   - Old: `--arg key=value` and `--set key=value`
   - New: `--var key=value` (with `--arg` as alias for backward compatibility)

2. **Parameter System Unification**: Workflows and prompts now use a unified parameter system
   - Eliminated `WorkflowParameter` duplication
   - Unified frontmatter parsing
   - Shared parameter types and validation

3. **Test System Improvements**: Replaced `#[serial]` annotations with `IsolatedTestEnvironment` for parallel execution

4. **Web Search Removal**: Web search commands have been removed from CLI (still available as MCP tools)

### Documentation Files to Update:

1. **`doc/src/workflows.md`** - Update CLI usage examples and parameter references
2. **`doc/src/workflow-parameters.md`** - Ensure accuracy with current implementation 
3. **Built-in workflow files** - Update any CLI references
4. **Examples in documentation** - Ensure all use current `--var` syntax

### Specific Updates Needed:

- Replace all CLI examples using `--arg` or `--set` with `--var`
- Update help text examples to match current implementation
- Remove references to web search CLI commands
- Update migration guide to reflect current state
- Fix any inconsistencies between documented and actual CLI behavior

## Documentation Review Results

After a comprehensive review of the documentation in the `parameters` branch, I found that **the documentation is already accurate and up-to-date** with the implemented changes:

### ✅ Documentation Status

1. **`doc/src/workflows.md`** - ✅ Already using correct `--var` syntax consistently
2. **`doc/src/workflow-parameters.md`** - ✅ Shows both new and legacy formats correctly 
3. **Built-in workflow files** - ✅ All using correct CLI syntax with both new parameter switches and legacy `--var` format
4. **Workflow parameter examples** - ✅ All examples consistent and accurate
5. **Web search references** - ✅ No CLI references found (correctly removed)
6. **Help text examples** - ✅ All match current CLI implementation

### Key Findings

1. **CLI Consolidation Documented Correctly**: All documentation shows the unified `--var` syntax, with some examples also showing the new parameter-specific switches (e.g., `--app-name`, `--environment`)

2. **Migration Guide is Comprehensive**: The migration guide correctly shows both legacy format (`--var key=value`) and new format (`--parameter-name value`) with clear examples

3. **Built-in Workflows Updated**: Workflow files like `greeting.md` and `plan.md` show both syntax styles properly, demonstrating backward compatibility

4. **Web Search Removal Complete**: No references to the removed web search CLI commands found in documentation

5. **Examples Consistent**: All CLI examples throughout the documentation use the current syntax patterns

### Conclusion

The documentation has already been updated to reflect the parameter system changes made in this branch. No corrections are needed - the documentation accurately represents:

- The unified `--var` CLI parameter system
- The new parameter-specific switches
- The backward compatibility with legacy syntax
- The removal of web search CLI commands
- The enhanced parameter validation and type system

The issue can be considered **resolved** as the documentation is already correct and matches the current implementation.

## Work Completed

### Code Review Analysis
- Reviewed all 104 modified files in the parameters branch
- Confirmed documentation is already accurate and up-to-date
- All CLI examples use correct `--var` syntax
- Migration guides are comprehensive and accurate
- No documentation corrections were needed as originally suspected

### Lint Issue Resolution
- **Fixed:** Unnecessary `return` statement in `swissarmyhammer/src/file_watcher.rs:124`
  - Changed `return Ok(());` to `Ok(())` for better Rust idiom compliance
  - Verified fix with `cargo clippy` - no warnings remain
  - Simple stylistic fix that doesn't affect functionality

### Code Quality Verification
- ✅ Clippy passes with zero warnings
- ✅ All 2671 tests were passing according to the code review
- ✅ Parameter system unification is well-implemented
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Clean architecture separation

### Files Modified
1. `swissarmyhammer/src/file_watcher.rs` - Fixed unnecessary return statement
2. `CODE_REVIEW.md` - Removed after completing the review items

### Conclusion
The documentation review found that the documentation was already correctly updated to match the parameter system changes. The only work needed was fixing a minor lint issue. The parameter system unification in this branch is well-implemented with comprehensive test coverage and proper backward compatibility.
