//! Surface adapters: how `expect` provisions, drives, observes, and tears down
//! the system under test.
//!
//! `ideas/expect.md` §"Surface adapters" defines a surface as a built-in engine
//! that both **drives** (causes the `When` transition) and **observes** (reads
//! the authoritative checkpoint state), in-process and mechanical — no Node, no
//! Python, no external test harness. §"Provisioning and Isolation" adds that
//! `expect` **owns the SUT lifecycle**: it provisions a fresh instance, drives
//! it, and tears it down, so a `check` gates *this code, built now*.
//!
//! [`SurfaceAdapter`] is the contract every surface implements. The lifecycle is
//! always the same four steps — provision → drive → observe → teardown — but the
//! *handle* each adapter carries between them differs (a built binary for cli, a
//! launched server for http, a scratch database for db), so the handle is an
//! [associated type](SurfaceAdapter::ProvisionedSut) the adapter owns rather than
//! a shared enum. New adapters slot in by implementing the trait with their own
//! handle type; nothing in the trait is cli-specific.
//!
//! The first adapter is [`cli`](crate::surface::cli) — the deterministic,
//! no-agent path: build the binary, run argv, read stdout/stderr/exit/files.
