# Final Validation and Quality Assurance  

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/cli_prompt.md

## Overview

Perform comprehensive final validation of the refactored prompt command system to ensure all requirements are met, no regressions exist, and the system is ready for production use. This includes end-to-end testing, performance validation, and user experience verification.

## Current State

- New prompt architecture implemented
- Legacy code removed  
- Tests and documentation updated
- Ready for final validation

## Goals

- Verify all specification requirements are met
- Confirm no functional regressions exist
- Validate performance characteristics
- Ensure excellent user experience
- Confirm architectural goals achieved

## Validation Steps

### 1. Specification Compliance Validation

**Checklist from Original Specification:**

- [ ] **Global Arguments for Prompt Commands**
  - `sah --verbose prompt list` works correctly
  - `sah --format=json prompt list` outputs valid JSON  
  - `sah --format=yaml prompt list` outputs valid YAML
  - `sah --debug prompt test help` shows debug information

- [ ] **Simplified List Command**
  - No more `--source` or `--category` filtering options
  - Shows all prompts from all sources automatically
  - Clean table output by default
  - Filters out partial templates automatically

- [ ] **Single Source of Truth**  
  - All prompt command logic in `commands/prompt/` module
  - No duplicate definitions between `cli.rs` and dynamic CLI
  - Clean command parsing with typed structures

- [ ] **CliContext Pattern**
  - Prompt commands receive CliContext instead of just TemplateContext
  - Global arguments accessible throughout prompt command execution
  - Clean separation of CLI parsing from business logic

- [ ] **Architecture Consistency**
  - Prompt commands use modern dynamic CLI pattern
  - Other commands remain unchanged during this phase
  - Pattern established for future command refactors

### 2. Functional Regression Testing

**Test Matrix:**

```bash
# Basic Commands
sah prompt list                              # Should show all prompts
sah prompt test help                         # Should prompt interactively  
sah prompt test help --var topic=git        # Should render with variable

# Global Arguments
sah --verbose prompt list                    # Should show detailed info
sah --format=json prompt list               # Should output valid JSON
sah --format=yaml prompt list               # Should output valid YAML  
sah --debug prompt test help                 # Should show debug output
sah --quiet prompt list                      # Should suppress non-essential output

# Error Scenarios  
sah prompt                                   # Should show help
sah prompt invalid-command                   # Should show error + help
sah prompt test nonexistent                  # Should show prompt not found error
sah prompt test help --var invalid_syntax   # Should show variable syntax error

# Edge Cases
sah prompt list | wc -l                      # Should work in pipes  
sah --format=json prompt list | jq length   # Should work with jq
echo "topic=git" | sah prompt test help --var topic=stdin  # Should handle input

# Other Commands (should be unchanged)
sah doctor                                   # Should still work
sah serve --help                             # Should still work 
sah flow list                                # Should still work
```

### 3. Performance Validation

**Performance Tests:**

```bash
# Time measurement for common operations
time sah prompt list                         # Should complete < 2 seconds
time sah --format=json prompt list           # Should complete < 3 seconds  
time sah prompt test help --var topic=test   # Should complete < 5 seconds

# Memory usage validation
# Monitor memory usage during prompt loading and rendering
# Should not use excessive memory for normal operations

# Concurrent usage
# Multiple simultaneous prompt commands should work correctly
```

### 4. User Experience Validation

**UX Checklist:**

- [ ] **Discoverability**  
  - `sah --help` clearly shows global arguments
  - `sah prompt --help` shows available subcommands
  - `sah prompt list --help` shows relevant help
  - `sah prompt test --help` shows detailed usage

- [ ] **Error Messages**
  - Clear, actionable error messages
  - Suggest corrections for common mistakes
  - No confusing technical jargon
  - Consistent error format across commands

- [ ] **Output Quality**
  - Table output is well-formatted and readable
  - JSON output is valid and well-structured
  - YAML output is clean and parseable
  - Verbose output provides useful additional information

- [ ] **Interactive Experience**
  - Parameter prompts are clear and helpful  
  - Default values shown appropriately
  - Input validation is user-friendly
  - Non-interactive mode works in CI/CD environments

### 5. Code Quality Validation

**Quality Checks:**

```bash
# Compilation and linting
cargo build                                  # Should compile cleanly
cargo clippy                                 # Should have no warnings
cargo fmt --check                            # Should be properly formatted

# Testing  
cargo test                                   # All tests should pass
cargo nextest run --fail-fast                # Integration tests should pass

# Documentation
cargo doc --no-deps                          # Documentation should build
```
