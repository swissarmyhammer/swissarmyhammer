Rename the TDD workflow file from `builtin/workflows/tdd.md` to `builtin/workflows/test.md`.

This is the first step in implementing the `sah test` command. We need to rename the existing TDD workflow file to match the new command name.

Tasks:
- Rename `builtin/workflows/tdd.md` to `builtin/workflows/test.md`
- Verify the file content remains the same
- Ensure the workflow still functions correctly after renaming

This change should be simple and straightforward, just renaming the file while preserving its content.
