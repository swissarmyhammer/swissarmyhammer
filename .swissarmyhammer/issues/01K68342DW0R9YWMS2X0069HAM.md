# Group MCP Tools with Help Heading

## Objective
Group the dynamically loaded MCP tools under a "MCP Tools" help heading in the CLI help output.

## Context
Currently, MCP tools are added dynamically via the API rather than using derive attributes. We need to use clap's programmatic API to group these tools under a dedicated help heading.

## Implementation Notes
- Use `next_help_heading("MCP Tools")` or similar API method when adding MCP tools
- This will be done in the dynamic tool registration code, not with derive attributes
- Should group all MCP-provided tools together for better organization in help output

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP tools appear under "MCP Tools" heading in CLI help
- [ ] Other commands remain ungrouped or in their existing groups
- [ ] Help output is more organized and user-friendly
