Implement the test command handler to run the TDD workflow.

This is the fourth step in implementing the `sah test` command. We need to implement the actual logic that will execute the TDD workflow when the command is run.

Tasks:
- Implement logic to run the TDD workflow
- Use existing workflow execution patterns from the implement command
- Ensure proper error handling
- Provide appropriate user feedback during execution
- Follow the established patterns for workflow execution

The handler should be similar to the implement command handler but tailored for the TDD workflow.
