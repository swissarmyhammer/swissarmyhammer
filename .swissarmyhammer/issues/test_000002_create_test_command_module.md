Create a new test command module in the CLI.

This is the second step in implementing the `sah test` command. We need to create a new module for the test command that will handle executing the TDD workflow.

Tasks:
- Create `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/test.rs`
- Implement command handler similar to `implement.rs`
- Follow the same patterns and conventions used in other command modules
- Use the existing TDD workflow execution patterns

The new module should be structured similarly to other command modules in the codebase, following the established patterns for consistency.
