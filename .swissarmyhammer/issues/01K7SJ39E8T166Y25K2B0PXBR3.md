# Remove notify_create from Documentation - Features

## Parent Issue
Eliminate notify_create Tool and Replace with Native MCP Notifications (01K7SHXK4XKMDREMXG7BFJ8YJ7)

## Summary
Remove notify_create tool from features documentation.

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-tools/doc/src/features.md` (around line 304)

## Tasks

1. Remove the "Notification System" section:
```markdown
### Notification System

Send notifications from AI to user through the logging system.

**Tool**: `notify_create`

- Send info, warning, or error notifications
- Include structured context data
- Rate-limited for safety
- Useful for alerting users during long operations
```

2. If there are other notification features (like MCP progress notifications), update the section to describe those instead

## Alternative

If we're adding MCP progress notifications, replace the content with:
```markdown
### Progress Notifications

Tools send real-time progress updates during long-running operations via MCP notifications.

**Features**:
- Streaming progress updates for shell commands
- File indexing progress with percentage complete
- Web search and fetch progress
- No LLM tool calls required - server-sent automatically

See [Progress Notifications](./architecture/progress-notifications.md) for details.
```

## Dependencies

Must be completed **after**:
- Remove notify_create from Tool Registry
- Phase 1: Implement MCP Progress Notification Infrastructure (01K7SHZ4203SMD2C6HTW1QV3ZP)

## Verification

- [ ] notify_create references removed from features.md
- [ ] MCP progress notifications documented (if implemented)
- [ ] `mdbook build swissarmyhammer-tools/doc/` succeeds
