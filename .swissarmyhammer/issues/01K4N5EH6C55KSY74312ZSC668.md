# Extract Workflow System to swissarmyhammer-workflow Domain Crate

## Problem
swissarmyhammer-tools currently depends on workflow functionality from the main crate, creating coupling that prevents full domain separation.

## Current Dependencies
```rust
// This import should be ELIMINATED:
use swissarmyhammer::workflow::{...};

// Found in this specific location:
- src/mcp/server.rs:11
```

## Proposed Solution
Create `swissarmyhammer-workflow` domain crate and move workflow functionality there.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create swissarmyhammer-workflow Crate
- [ ] Create new domain crate structure
- [ ] Move workflow functionality from main crate
- [ ] Set up dependencies on swissarmyhammer-templating (once available)

### Phase 2: Update swissarmyhammer-tools
- [ ] Add swissarmyhammer-workflow dependency
- [ ] Update imports from `swissarmyhammer::workflow` to `swissarmyhammer_workflow`
- [ ] Verify functionality still works

## COMPLETION CRITERIA - How to Know This Issue is REALLY Done

**This issue is complete when the following import NO LONGER EXISTS in swissarmyhammer-tools:**

```rust
// This import should be ELIMINATED:
use swissarmyhammer::workflow::{

// Found in this specific location:
- src/mcp/server.rs:11
```

**And replaced with:**
```rust
use swissarmyhammer_workflow::{...};
```

**Verification Command:**
```bash
# Should return ZERO results when done:
rg "use swissarmyhammer::workflow" swissarmyhammer-tools/

# Should find new imports:
rg "use swissarmyhammer_workflow" swissarmyhammer-tools/
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Current**: 23 imports from main crate
- **After completion**: 22 imports from main crate (1 workflow import eliminated)

**Dependencies:**
- Requires swissarmyhammer-templating to be completed first
- May require error migration to be completed first
