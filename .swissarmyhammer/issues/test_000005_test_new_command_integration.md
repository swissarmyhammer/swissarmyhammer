Test the new `sah test` command integration.

This is the final step in implementing the `sah test` command. We need to verify that the command works correctly and integrates properly with the existing system.

Tasks:
- Verify the command works as expected
- Test different scenarios and edge cases
- Ensure integration with existing workflows
- Test error conditions and proper error reporting
- Verify the command follows the same patterns as other commands
- Check that the TDD workflow executes correctly when the command is run

This step ensures that the new command is fully functional and properly integrated into the SwissArmyHammer ecosystem.
