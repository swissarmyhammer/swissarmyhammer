# Research and Setup Memoranda Implementation

## Overview
Research the memoranda repository functionality and set up the foundation for implementing memoranda features in swissarmyhammer.

## Tasks

### 1. Deep Analysis of Memoranda Repository
- Analyze the original memoranda codebase at https://github.com/swissarmyhammer/memoranda  
- Document the core data structures (Memo, MemoId, etc.)
- Understand the API surface area and functionality
- Document storage patterns and file formats used

### 2. Architecture Planning  
- Review swissarmyhammer's existing MCP infrastructure in `swissarmyhammer/src/mcp/`
- Study the issues implementation in `swissarmyhammer/src/issues/` as a reference pattern
- Plan how memoranda will integrate with existing storage patterns
- Design the module structure for `swissarmyhammer/src/memoranda/`

### 3. Directory Structure Setup
- Create the storage directory structure: `.swissarmyhammer/memos/`
- Ensure proper permissions and error handling for directory creation
- Follow the local repository root storage requirement from specification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis document of memoranda functionality
- [ ] Architecture plan that follows existing patterns
- [ ] Directory structure created and tested
- [ ] Clear understanding of data structures needed

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on understanding before coding
- This is a research-heavy step to ensure proper design
- Build on existing swissarmyhammer patterns, especially from issues module
- Storage should be in `./.swissarmyhammer/memos` per specification
