make sure each of the subcommand description.md is accurate and really sells the feature


## Proposed Solution

After reviewing all 9 CLI subcommand descriptions, I'll improve each one to be more compelling and accurate. The goal is to make each description "sell" the feature by:

1. **agent** - Already excellent, comprehensive coverage of discovery, precedence, workflows
2. **doctor** - Too brief, needs to better sell its diagnostic capabilities
3. **flow** - Good structure but could emphasize power and flexibility more
4. **implement** - Good but could be more concise and compelling
5. **plan** - Good detail but could better highlight the AI-powered planning benefits
6. **prompt** - Well-structured but could emphasize the power of prompt management
7. **serve** - Good technical detail but could better sell the MCP integration value
8. **validate** - Good but could emphasize the safety and quality benefits
9. **rule** - Excellent comprehensive documentation, well-structured

### Specific Improvements Needed:
- **doctor**: Emphasize peace of mind, quick diagnostics, saves debugging time
- **flow**: Highlight flexibility, power, resumability as key differentiators
- **implement**: Focus on autonomous capability, hands-off operation
- **plan**: Emphasize AI-powered intelligent planning, context awareness
- **prompt**: Highlight template power, reusability, testing capabilities
- **serve**: Better sell the Claude Code integration story
- **validate**: Emphasize catching problems early, quality assurance

## Implementation Notes

Successfully improved all 7 CLI subcommand descriptions. Each description now:

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **doctor** - Transformed from brief checklist to comprehensive diagnostic value proposition
   - Emphasized time-saving, peace of mind, early detection
   - Added clear "Why Use Doctor" section
   - Expanded usage examples and troubleshooting

2. **flow** - Enhanced from basic usage to compelling workflow automation story
   - Highlighted state machine power, resumability, reliability
   - Emphasized AI integration capabilities
   - Expanded examples showing workflow lifecycle

3. **implement** - Upgraded from simple workflow description to autonomous coding pitch
   - Focused on hands-free operation, complete automation
   - Emphasized continuous execution and systematic approach
   - Added compelling use cases (morning routine, background processing)

4. **plan** - Enhanced from file-to-issues converter to AI-powered planning system
   - Emphasized intelligent analysis, context awareness
   - Highlighted codebase understanding and pattern following
   - Added workflow integration examples

5. **prompt** - Transformed from command reference to template power showcase
   - Emphasized reusability, consistency, quality benefits
   - Highlighted Liquid template capabilities
   - Added comprehensive prompt creation guidance

6. **serve** - Enhanced from technical MCP description to AI integration bridge
   - Better sold Claude Code integration story
   - Emphasized complete tool ecosystem access
   - Added security considerations and setup guidance

7. **validate** - Upgraded from validation tool to quality assurance system
   - Emphasized early error detection, CI/CD integration
   - Highlighted comprehensive checking capabilities
   - Added practical CI/CD integration examples

### Common Themes Applied:
- Lead with benefits and value proposition
- Include comprehensive "Why Use" sections
- Provide real-world workflow examples
- Add troubleshooting and best practices
- Structure for easy scanning and comprehension
- Emphasize AI-powered intelligence where applicable

- /Users/wballard/github/sah/swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/serve/description.md
- /Users/wballard/github/sah/swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/validate/description.md

### Not Modified (Already Excellent):
- **agent** - Already comprehensive with excellent structure
- **rule** - Already excellent with complete documentation

All descriptions now effectively "sell" their features while remaining accurate and comprehensive.
