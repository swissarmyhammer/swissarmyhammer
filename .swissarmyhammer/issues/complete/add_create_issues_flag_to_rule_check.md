# Add --create-issues Flag to sah rule check Command

## Objective

Add a `--create-issues` flag to the `sah rule check` command that automatically creates issues for ERROR level rule violations.

## Requirements

### Issue Creation Behavior

1. **Only ERROR Level**: Create issues only for violations with ERROR severity level
2. **One Issue Per Rule+File**: Create a separate issue for each unique combination of rule and file
3. **Naming Convention**: Use format `~<rule_name>_<file_hash>.md`
   - The `~` prefix sorts issues to the end of the list
   - `<rule_name>`: The name of the violated rule (e.g., `no-unwrap`, `no-hardcoded-secrets`)
   - `<file_hash>`: A hash of the file path to ensure uniqueness
4. **Issue Content**: Use the violation report from the rule check as the issue body
   - Same formatted report that's currently logged to console
   - Should include file path, line number, rule name, and violation message

### Duplicate Prevention

- Check for existing issues with the same name before creating
- If an issue already exists (same rule + file combination), skip creation
- This allows re-running `sah rule check --create-issues` without creating duplicates

### Integration

- Use existing code from `swissarmyhammer-issues` crate for issue creation
- Follow existing issue creation patterns in the codebase
- Ensure proper error handling if issue creation fails

## Implementation Notes

### File Hash Generation

- Use a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 truncated, or simpler path-based hash)
- Hash should be deterministic based on file path
- Keep hash short enough for reasonable filenames (8-12 characters)

### Issue Format

```markdown
# Rule Violation: <rule_name>

**File**: <file_path>
**Line**: <line_number>
**Severity**: ERROR

## Violation

<violation_message>

## Details

<additional_context_if_available>
```

### CLI Flag

```bash
# Example usage
sah rule check --create-issues
sah rule check --create-issues --rule-names no-unwrap,no-panic
sah rule check --create-issues --file-paths src/**/*.rs
```

## Testing Requirements

- Test that issues are created for ERROR violations
- Test that duplicate issues are not created
- Test that issue names follow the correct format
- Test that non-ERROR violations don't create issues
- Test integration with existing `--rule-names` and `--file-paths` filters

## Files to Modify

- `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs` - Add flag and issue creation logic
- `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/cli.rs` - Add CLI argument definition
- Integration with `swissarmyhammer-issues` crate for issue operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `--create-issues` flag added to `sah rule check` command
- [ ] Issues created only for ERROR level violations
- [ ] Issue names follow `~<rule>_<filehash>.md` format
- [ ] Duplicate issues are not created on re-runs
- [ ] Issue body contains full violation report
- [ ] Works with existing filter flags (--rule-names, --file-paths)
- [ ] Tests cover all scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, here's my implementation approach:

### 1. Architecture Changes

The current rule checking architecture uses fail-fast behavior where ERROR violations immediately return `Err(RuleError::Violation)`. For the `--create-issues` flag to work, we need to:

1. **Collect violations instead of failing fast**: When `--create-issues` is enabled, we need to collect all ERROR violations rather than stopping at the first one
2. **Modify checker behavior**: Add a mode to `RuleChecker` that collects violations without failing fast
3. **Create issues after collection**: Once all violations are collected, create issues for each unique rule+file combination

### 2. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Add CLI Flag (cli.rs)
- Add `create_issues: bool` field to `CheckCommand` struct
- Parse the `--create-issues` flag in `parse_rule_command`

#### Step 2: Modify RuleChecker to Support Collection Mode (checker.rs)
- Add a new method `check_with_filters_collect` that collects violations instead of failing fast
- Modify `check_all` to accept a collection mode flag
- When in collection mode, store violations in a Vec instead of returning errors
- Return `RuleCheckResult` with populated `violations` field

#### Step 3: Implement Issue Creation Logic (check.rs)
- Import `swissarmyhammer-issues` types
- Create helper function to generate deterministic file path hash (8 chars from SHA-256)
- Create helper function to format issue name: `~{rule_name}_{file_hash}.md`
- Create helper function to format issue content with violation details
- After collecting violations, iterate and create issues:
  - Check if issue already exists (skip if so)
  - Create issue with formatted name and content
  - Log creation or skipping

#### Step 4: Add Tests
- Test CLI flag parsing
- Test that collection mode returns all violations
- Test issue name generation
- Test issue content formatting
- Test duplicate prevention
- Test integration with filters

### 3. Key Design Decisions

**Decision 1: Collection Mode vs Fail-Fast**
- Keep existing fail-fast behavior as default
- Only collect violations when `--create-issues` is enabled
- This maintains backward compatibility

**Decision 2: File Hash Algorithm**
- Use SHA-256 hash of the file path
- Take first 8 characters of hex digest
- This provides good uniqueness while keeping filenames readable

**Decision 3: Issue Content Format**
```markdown
# Rule Violation: {rule_name}

**File**: {file_path}
**Severity**: ERROR

## Violation Message

{llm_response_message}

---
*This issue was automatically created by `sah rule check --create-issues`*
```

**Decision 4: Error Handling**
- If issue creation fails for one violation, log warning and continue
- Don't fail the entire check operation due to issue creation failure
- Return success if all checks completed, even if some issue creations failed

### 4. File Structure Changes

```
swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/
├── cli.rs (add create_issues field to CheckCommand)
├── check.rs (add issue creation logic)
└── mod.rs (no changes needed)

swissarmyhammer-rules/src/
├── checker.rs (add collection mode support)
└── error.rs (no changes needed - RuleViolation already has needed fields)
```

### 5. Dependencies
- Add `sha2` crate to `swissarmyhammer-cli` for hashing (if not already present)
- Already have `swissarmyhammer-issues` available

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for hash generation function
- Unit tests for issue name formatting
- Unit tests for issue content formatting
- Integration test with real rule checker
- Test with multiple violations in same file
- Test with multiple violations in different files
- Test duplicate prevention



---

## Implementation Completed

### Changes Made

1. **CLI Argument Registration** (swissarmyhammer-cli/src/dynamic_cli.rs:1308-1313)
   - Added `--create-issues` flag to the `build_rule_command()` function
   - Uses `ArgAction::SetTrue` for boolean flag behavior
   - Placed after category argument in the command definition

2. **Checker Collection Mode** (swissarmyhammer-rules/src/checker.rs:645-686)
   - Fixed error handling in `check_all_collect_errors()` method
   - Changed from using `downcast_ref()` (not supported) to `is_rule_violation()` method
   - Reconstructs RuleViolation from error information when in collection mode
   - Properly propagates non-violation errors

3. **Issue Name Generation** (swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs:254-258)
   - Replaces slashes in rule names with underscores for filesystem safety
   - Uses format: `~{safe_rule_name}_{file_hash}`
   - Example: `security/no-hardcoded-secrets` becomes `~security_no-hardcoded-secrets_ce35117c`

4. **Compilation Fixes**
   - Fixed Mutex type mismatch in swissarmyhammer-search/src/embedding.rs (lines 167, 427)
   - Changed `Mutex::new()` to `tokio::sync::Mutex::new()` for correct async usage

### Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ `test_generate_issue_name_with_slashes` - Tests slash replacement in rule names
- ✅ `test_generate_file_hash` - Tests deterministic hashing
- ✅ `test_generate_issue_name` - Tests basic issue name generation
- ✅ `test_format_issue_content` - Tests issue content formatting
- ✅ All integration tests pass

### Manual Testing

Verified with test file `test_violation.rs`:
1. First run: Successfully created issue `~security_no-hardcoded-secrets_ce35117c.md`
2. Second run: Correctly skipped creation (duplicate prevention working)
3. Issue content properly formatted with rule name, file path, severity, and violation message

### Key Implementation Details

1. **File Hash**: Uses SHA-256 truncated to 8 characters for uniqueness
2. **Slash Handling**: Critical fix - replaces `/` with `_` in rule names to avoid filesystem errors
3. **Error Recovery**: Logs warnings for failed issue creations but continues processing
4. **Collection Mode**: Only activates when `--create-issues` flag is used, preserving fail-fast for normal usage
