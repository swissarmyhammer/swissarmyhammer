# Remove notify_create References from Builtin Prompts

## Parent Issue
Eliminate notify_create Tool and Replace with Native MCP Notifications (01K7SM38449JYA2KZP4KNKQ05X)

## Summary
Remove notify_create tool references from builtin prompt templates.

## Locations
- `builtin/prompts/are_tests_passing.md`
- `builtin/prompts/test.md`

## Tasks

1. Check `builtin/prompts/are_tests_passing.md` for notify_create references
   - If found, remove or update to not mention the tool
   - Prompts should not instruct LLM to call notify_create

2. Check `builtin/prompts/test.md` for notify_create references
   - If found, remove or update to not mention the tool
   - Prompts should not instruct LLM to call notify_create

3. Update prompts to reflect that:
   - Progress notifications are sent automatically by tools
   - LLM does not need to explicitly notify users
   - Tools handle progress updates transparently

## Example Update

If a prompt says:
```markdown
After running tests, use notify_create to inform the user of the results.
```

Change to:
```markdown
After running tests, report the results in your response.
```

Or simply remove the notification instruction entirely, as the shell tool will send progress notifications automatically.

## Dependencies

Must be completed **after**:
- Phase 1: Implement MCP Progress Notification Infrastructure (01K7SHZ4203SMD2C6HTW1QV3ZP)

## Verification

- [ ] All notify_create references removed from prompts
- [ ] Prompts do not instruct LLM to call removed tool
- [ ] Prompts reflect current notification architecture
- [ ] `sah prompt list` shows updated prompts

## Proposed Solution

After examining the builtin/prompts directory, I found that:

1. **`are_tests_passing.md`** - No references to `notify_create` found ✓
2. **`test.md`** - No references to `notify_create` found ✓
3. **`builtin/prompts/.system/local_model.md.liquid`** - Contains 2 references to `notify_create`:
   - Line 37: Instructions to use `notify_create` for user communication
   - Line 58: Instructions to keep user informed with `notify_create`

### Implementation Steps

1. Edit `builtin/prompts/.system/local_model.md.liquid` to remove both references to `notify_create`
   - Line 37: Change from "Provide the user regular feedback and status reports by using the `notify_create` tool" to "Provide the user regular feedback and status reports in your responses"
   - Line 58: Remove the bullet point "Keep the user informed with `notify_create`"

2. The changes align with the new architecture where:
   - Tools automatically send MCP progress notifications
   - The LLM does not need to explicitly call any notification tool
   - Direct text responses to the user are the primary communication mechanism

### Testing Plan

After making the changes:
1. Verify the file is syntactically correct (valid Liquid template)
2. Check that no other references to `notify_create` exist in the builtin/prompts directory
3. Ensure the modified prompt still provides clear guidance on user communication



## Implementation Notes

### Changes Made

Successfully removed all `notify_create` references from builtin prompts:

**File: `builtin/prompts/.system/local_model.md.liquid`**

1. **Line 37 - User Communication Section**
   - **Before:** `- **User Communication:** Provide the user regular feedback and status reports by using the `notify_create` tool.`
   - **After:** `- **User Communication:** Provide the user regular feedback and status reports in your responses.`
   - **Rationale:** Direct text responses are now the primary communication mechanism, as tools automatically send MCP progress notifications.

2. **Line 58 - Git Repository Section**
   - **Before:** Three bullet points including "Keep the user informed with `notify_create`"
   - **After:** Removed the `notify_create` bullet point entirely
   - **Rationale:** Redundant instruction removed; communication guidelines are already covered in the User Communication section above.

### Verification Results

1. ✅ **Grep search confirmed:** No remaining `notify_create` references in `builtin/prompts/` directory
2. ✅ **Build successful:** `cargo build` completed without errors, confirming Liquid template syntax is valid
3. ✅ **Files checked:**
   - `are_tests_passing.md` - No references found (was already clean)
   - `test.md` - No references found (was already clean)
   - `.system/local_model.md.liquid` - 2 references removed

### Architecture Alignment

The changes align with the new MCP progress notification architecture:
- Tools automatically send progress notifications via MCP protocol
- LLM agents communicate with users through direct text responses
- No explicit notification tool calls are needed
- Progress updates are handled transparently by the tool infrastructure
