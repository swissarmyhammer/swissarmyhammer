## Proposed Solution

I will perform comprehensive integration testing and validation of all five file tools to ensure they work together seamlessly and meet the specification requirements. My approach:

### 1. Tool Availability Verification
- Verify all five tools (read, write, edit, glob, grep) are properly registered
- Test MCP server startup and tool discovery
- Validate tool schema definitions match specification

### 2. Individual Tool Validation
- Test each tool against its specification requirements
- Verify parameter validation and error handling
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Validate security measures and workspace boundaries

### 3. Integration Testing
- Test tool composition workflows (Glob â†’ Read â†’ Edit)
- Verify tools work together for complex operations
- Test concurrent tool usage
- Validate error handling across tool chains

### 4. Performance Benchmarking  
- Measure tool performance on large files/codebases
- Test memory usage and resource cleanup
- Validate timeout handling and responsiveness
- Compare against performance requirements

### 5. Security Audit
- Test workspace boundary enforcement
- Validate path sanitization and security checks
- Test file permission handling
- Verify no security vulnerabilities

### 6. Specification Compliance
- Cross-check each tool against original specification
- Verify all parameters and functionality match
- Test all documented use cases
- Validate integration patterns work as described

### 7. Quality Assurance
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Check code quality and standards compliance
- Verify documentation accuracy
- Test error messages and user experience

This systematic approach will ensure the file tools are production-ready and meet all requirements.

## Code Review Resolution

### Property Test Fix (2025-08-18)
Fixed property test failure in `test_edit_deterministic_property` that occurred when randomly generated `old_string` and `new_string` values were identical. The edit tool correctly validates that these strings must be different, so the test was updated with:

```rust
// Skip this test case if old_string equals new_string (not allowed by edit tool)
prop_assume!(old_string != new_string);
```

**Result**: All 2,672 tests now pass (previously 2,671 passed, 1 failed)
**Files Modified**: `swissarmyhammer-tools/tests/file_tools_property_tests.rs:105`
**Validation**: Property test validation is working correctly as expected
