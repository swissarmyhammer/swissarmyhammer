# Create Integration Tests for Notify Tool

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/notify_tool.md

## Objective
Create integration tests that verify the notify tool works correctly through the MCP protocol and integrates properly with the overall system.

## Tasks
1. Create integration test file in appropriate test directory
2. Test tool execution through MCP protocol
3. Verify logging output with correct target
4. Test tool registration and discovery
5. Test error handling through MCP interface
6. Verify structured context handling in real scenarios

## Integration Test Requirements

### MCP Protocol Tests
- Test tool discovery through MCP tools list
- Test tool execution via MCP call interface
- Verify request/response handling through protocol
- Test parameter validation through MCP layer
- Ensure proper error propagation through MCP

### Logging Integration Tests
- Verify logging appears with "llm_notify" target
- Test log level filtering capabilities
- Confirm structured context appears in logs
- Test concurrent logging from multiple tool calls

### System Integration Tests
- Test tool registry integration
- Verify tool doesn't interfere with existing tools
- Test resource cleanup after tool execution
- Verify thread safety of logging operations

### End-to-End Scenarios
- Test realistic notification scenarios
- Verify logging output in various contexts
- Test error recovery and handling
- Validate performance under load

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing integration test patterns from other tools
- Include proper test environment setup
- Use real logging capture for verification
- Follow established async test patterns
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## Success Criteria
- Tool executes correctly through MCP protocol
- Logging integration works as specified
- Tool registration and discovery function properly
- Error handling works through all layers
- Integration tests pass consistently

## Dependencies
- Build on unit tests from step 000007

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing notify tool implementation and the established test patterns in the codebase, I'll implement comprehensive integration tests that verify the notify tool works correctly through all layers of the system.

### Integration Test Structure

I'll create integration tests in `swissarmyhammer-tools/tests/notify_integration_tests.rs` following the established patterns and covering:

#### 1. MCP Protocol Tests
- **Tool Discovery**: Verify the notify tool is discoverable through the MCP tools list
- **Tool Execution**: Test tool execution via MCP call interface with proper JSON-RPC handling
- **Parameter Validation**: Test parameter validation through the MCP layer
- **Error Propagation**: Ensure proper error propagation through MCP protocol

#### 2. Logging Integration Tests
- **Target Verification**: Verify logging appears with "llm_notify" target
- **Log Level Testing**: Test all notification levels (info, warn, error) produce correct log output
- **Context Handling**: Verify structured context appears correctly in logs
- **Log Capture**: Use proper logging infrastructure to capture and verify log output

#### 3. System Integration Tests
- **Tool Registry**: Test tool registration and discovery through the registry
- **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limiting integration works correctly
- **Concurrent Access**: Test thread safety of logging operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verify proper resource cleanup after tool execution

#### 4. End-to-End Scenarios
- **Realistic Workflows**: Test realistic notification scenarios matching the specification
- **Error Recovery**: Test error handling through all system layers  
- **Performance Under Load**: Verify performance characteristics
- **Unicode and Edge Cases**: Test with complex messages and contexts

### Implementation Approach

Using established patterns from the codebase:
- **IsolatedTestEnvironment**: For proper test isolation
- **Test Context Creation**: Using `create_test_context()` pattern
- **Log Capture**: Following existing logging test patterns
- **Async Testing**: Using `#[tokio::test]` with proper async patterns
- **Rate Limiter Mocking**: Using MockRateLimiter for consistent testing
- **Error Assertion**: Comprehensive error condition testing

### Technical Implementation

The tests will directly test the NotifyTool through:
1. **Direct Tool Interface**: Testing McpTool trait implementation
2. **Registry Integration**: Testing through ToolRegistry for realistic scenarios
3. **Log Verification**: Using tracing-test or similar for log capture
4. **Concurrent Testing**: Multiple simultaneous notifications
5. **Real MCP Scenarios**: Testing actual MCP protocol interaction patterns

This approach builds on the solid unit test foundation (from issue 000007) and verifies the tool works correctly in realistic integration scenarios, ensuring all requirements from the specification are met.
