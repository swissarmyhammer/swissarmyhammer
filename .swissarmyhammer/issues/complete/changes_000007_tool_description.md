# Step 7: Create Tool Description Documentation

Refer to ideas/changes.md

## Objective

Create comprehensive `description.md` for the git_changes tool.

## Tasks

1. Create `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/git/changes/description.md`
   - Tool title and purpose
   - Parameters section with examples
   - Returns section with response format
   - Edge cases documentation
   - Usage examples (feature branch, main branch, uncommitted changes)
   - Error conditions

2. Follow existing description.md pattern from other tools
   - Use markdown formatting
   - Include JSON examples
   - Document all parameters
   - Provide multiple usage scenarios

3. Include key concepts:
   - Parent branch detection
   - Merge-base calculation
   - Root branch vs feature branch behavior
   - Uncommitted changes inclusion

## Success Criteria

- description.md exists and is comprehensive
- Follows established pattern from other tools
- All parameters and responses documented
- Examples are clear and useful
- Edge cases are explained

## Files to Create

- `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/git/changes/description.md`

## Estimated Code Changes

~100 lines (documentation)

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the implementation and existing description.md patterns, I will enhance the git_changes tool description with:

1. **Expanded Purpose Section**: Explain the tool's role in workflow analysis and code review
2. **Detailed Parameters**: Document the branch parameter with type information
3. **Comprehensive Examples**: Add examples for:
   - Feature/issue branches (showing parent detection)
   - Main/trunk branches (showing all tracked files)
   - Branches with uncommitted changes
4. **Response Format Section**: Document the GitChangesResponse structure with:
   - branch field (string)
   - parent_branch field (optional string)
   - files array (list of file paths)
   - Include example JSON responses
5. **Key Concepts**: Explain:
   - Parent branch detection for issue/ branches
   - Merge-base calculation
   - Root branch vs feature branch behavior
   - Uncommitted changes inclusion (staged, unstaged, untracked)
6. **Use Cases**: Document practical scenarios where this tool is useful

The current description.md is minimal. I'll expand it to match the comprehensive style of files/read/description.md and shell/execute/description.md.

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created comprehensive description.md for the git_changes tool following the established pattern from other SwissArmyHammer tools.

### What Was Done

1. **Enhanced Structure**: Expanded from basic 3-section format to comprehensive documentation
2. **Added Purpose Section**: Explained the tool's role in workflow automation and code review
3. **Key Concepts Section**: Documented:
   - Parent branch detection algorithm (issue/ prefix triggers merge-base calculation)
   - Distinction between feature branches and root branches
   - Uncommitted changes inclusion (staged, unstaged, untracked, renamed)
4. **Detailed Parameters**: Documented the branch parameter with type and examples
5. **Response Format**: Provided complete JSON structure with field descriptions
6. **Comprehensive Examples**: Added 4 example scenarios:
   - Feature branch with automatic parent detection
   - Main branch returning all tracked files
   - Branch with uncommitted changes
7. **Use Cases**: Documented 4 practical applications:
   - Code review preparation
   - Change impact analysis
   - Workflow automation
   - Repository overview
8. **Edge Cases**: Documented 3 edge scenarios:
   - Branches without parent (non-issue/ branches)
   - Clean branches with no changes
   - Branches with only uncommitted changes
9. **Error Conditions**: Listed common error scenarios

### Verification

- ✅ Cargo build successful
- ✅ All 10 git_changes tests passing
- ✅ Description embedded correctly via include_str! macro
- ✅ Follows markdown formatting standards from other tools
- ✅ JSON examples are valid and realistic

### Pattern Consistency

The description follows the same comprehensive pattern as:
- `files/read/description.md` (detailed with multiple example categories)
- `shell/execute/description.md` (extensive purpose and use case sections)

Total documentation: ~150 lines covering all aspects of the tool.
