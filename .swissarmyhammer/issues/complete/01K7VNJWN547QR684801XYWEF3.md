# Complete removal of branch creation tests

## Remaining failing tests in operations.rs

The following tests still reference deleted branch creation functions and need to be removed:

- `debug_branch_creation_issue` - references `create_work_branch_simple`  
- `test_find_merge_target_nested_branching` - references `create_and_checkout_branch`

These tests are located around lines 893-1166 in `swissarmyhammer-git/src/operations.rs`.

## Action needed

Delete or comment out these obsolete tests so the codebase builds and tests pass.
