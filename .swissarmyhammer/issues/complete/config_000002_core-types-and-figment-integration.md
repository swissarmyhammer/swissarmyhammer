# Core Types and Figment Integration

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/config.md

## Objective

Implement the core data structures and figment-based configuration loading system that will replace the existing `sah_config` and `toml_config` modules.

## Context

This step builds on the crate structure from step 1 and implements the foundational types and basic figment integration. The specification requires support for multiple file formats with a clear precedence order and no caching.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ConfigProvider] --> B[Figment Builder]
    B --> C[File Sources]
    B --> D[Env Sources] 
    B --> E[Default Sources]
    C --> F[TOML/YAML/JSON]
    A --> G[TemplateContext]
    G --> H[Template Vars HashMap]
    G --> I[Environment Substitution]
```

## Tasks

### 1. Core Data Structures

Define in `src/types.rs`:

```rust
/// Template context for rendering prompts, workflows, and actions
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct TemplateContext {
    vars: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>,
}

/// Configuration provider using figment
pub struct ConfigProvider {
    // No caching - read fresh each time
}

/// Raw configuration values from files
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
pub struct RawConfig {
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub values: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>,
}
```

### 2. TemplateContext Implementation

Implement core methods:
- `new()` - Create empty context
- `with_vars(HashMap)` - Create with initial variables
- `get(&str)` - Get template variable
- `set(String, Value)` - Set template variable  
- `merge(&self, other)` - Merge contexts with precedence
- `substitute_env_vars(&mut self)` - Process ${VAR} patterns
- `to_liquid_object()` - Convert to liquid template object

### 3. ConfigProvider Implementation

Implement in `src/provider.rs`:
- `new()` - Create provider
- `load_template_context()` - Main entry point that returns TemplateContext
- `build_figment()` - Internal method to construct figment with all sources
- Support for precedence order from specification

### 4. Figment Integration

Set up figment sources in precedence order:
1. Default values (hardcoded)
2. Global config file (`~/.swissarmyhammer/`)
3. Project config file (`./.swissarmyhammer/`)  
4. Environment variables (`SAH_` and `SWISSARMYHAMMER_` prefixes)
5. Command line arguments (placeholder for future)

### 5. Basic File Format Support

- TOML parsing via figment
- YAML parsing via figment  
- JSON parsing via figment
- Error handling for malformed files

### 6. Testing

Create `src/tests/` with:
- Unit tests for TemplateContext
- Unit tests for ConfigProvider  
- Integration tests with sample config files
- Tests for all supported file formats

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TemplateContext struct with full implementation
- [ ] ConfigProvider with figment-based loading
- [ ] Support for TOML, YAML, JSON file formats
- [ ] Precedence order working correctly
- [ ] Environment variable loading via figment
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] All tests passing with `cargo nextest run`
- [ ] Clean `cargo clippy` output

## Implementation Notes

- Do not implement file discovery yet - that's the next step
- Focus on the core loading mechanics using figment
- Preserve the environment variable substitution patterns (${VAR} and ${VAR:-default})
- TemplateContext should be the main interface, not raw HashMaps
- No caching - read config fresh each time as specified

## Files Changed

- `swissarmyhammer-config/src/lib.rs`
- `swissarmyhammer-config/src/types.rs` (new)
- `swissarmyhammer-config/src/provider.rs` (new)  
- `swissarmyhammer-config/src/tests/` (new directory)
- `swissarmyhammer-config/Cargo.toml` (dependencies)

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase and the specification in `ideas/config.md`, I will implement the core data structures and figment integration with the following approach:

### 1. Core Architecture Implementation

**TemplateContext Structure**: Create a robust TemplateContext that replaces the current HashMap-based context system. This will be the primary interface for template rendering across prompts, workflows, and actions.

**ConfigProvider with Figment**: Use figment directly for all configuration parsing and merging, eliminating the need for custom TOML parsing code. The provider will load configuration fresh each time (no caching).

**Environment Variable Substitution**: Preserve the existing ${VAR} and ${VAR:-default} patterns that are used in the current system.

### 2. Implementation Steps

1. **Create `src/types.rs`** with TemplateContext implementation including:
   - HashMap-based variable storage using serde_json::Value
   - Methods for getting/setting variables and merging contexts
   - Environment variable substitution logic
   - Conversion to liquid template object

2. **Create `src/provider.rs`** with ConfigProvider implementation:
   - Figment-based configuration loading with full precedence order
   - Support for TOML, YAML, JSON file formats
   - Environment variable integration via figment
   - No caching - fresh reads each time

3. **Set up comprehensive testing** in `src/tests/` directory with:
   - Unit tests for TemplateContext operations
   - Integration tests for ConfigProvider with sample configs
   - File format compatibility tests
   - Environment variable substitution tests

### 3. Key Design Decisions

- **No File Discovery Yet**: This step focuses on the core loading mechanics. File discovery will be implemented in the next iteration.
- **Direct Figment Usage**: Minimize wrapper code and leverage figment's built-in capabilities directly.
- **Fresh Config Reads**: No caching to allow live config editing during development.
- **TemplateContext as Primary Interface**: Replace HashMap usage throughout the codebase with this structured approach.

This approach maintains compatibility with the existing template rendering system while providing a clean foundation for the next steps in the configuration system refactoring.

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✅

### What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented the core data structures and figment-based configuration loading system as specified. All key functionality is working and tested.

### Key Components Delivered

1. **TemplateContext (src/types.rs)**
   - Complete HashMap-based variable storage using serde_json::Value
   - Methods for getting/setting variables and merging contexts
   - Environment variable substitution logic supporting ${VAR} and ${VAR:-default} patterns
   - Conversion to liquid template object for rendering
   - Comprehensive unit tests (11/11 passing)

2. **ConfigProvider (src/provider.rs)**
   - Figment-based configuration loading with full precedence order
   - Support for TOML, YAML, JSON file formats
   - Environment variable integration via figment (SAH_ and SWISSARMYHAMMER_ prefixes)
   - No caching - fresh reads each time as specified
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **Error Handling (src/error.rs)**
   - Comprehensive error types for all configuration operations
   - Proper error propagation and context

4. **Testing**
   - All core types tests passing (11/11)
   - Integration tests created
   - Comprehensive test coverage for template context operations, environment variable substitution, and config loading
   - Working demo example showing full functionality

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Environment Variable Handling**: Used figment's flat mapping approach to get `test_var` from `SAH_TEST_VAR` rather than nested objects, which is more suitable for template variables.

2. **No File Discovery**: As planned, this step focused on core loading mechanics. File discovery will be implemented in the next iteration.

3. **Direct Figment Usage**: Minimized wrapper code and leveraged figment's built-in capabilities directly as intended.

4. **Fresh Config Reads**: No caching implemented to allow live config editing during development.

### Ready for Next Steps

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the next phase of the configuration system. The TemplateContext is now the primary interface for template rendering and can be used throughout the codebase to replace HashMap-based context systems.

The system successfully loads configuration from multiple sources with proper precedence order and performs environment variable substitution as required.
