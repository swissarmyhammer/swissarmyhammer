# Fix CLI Help Heading Display

## Problem

The CLI help output shows headings incorrectly - they appear as part of command descriptions instead of as separate section headers:

```
Commands:
  _implement       ──────── WORKFLOWS ──────── | Autonomously run until all issues are resolved
  file             ──────── TOOLS ──────── | FILE management commands (MCP Tool)
```

**Expected**:
```
Commands:
  serve            Run as MCP server
  doctor           Diagnose configuration and setup issues
  
Workflows:
  implement        Autonomously run until all issues are resolved
  plan             Turn specifications into multiple step plans
  
Tools:
  file             FILE management commands (MCP Tool)
  issue            ISSUE management commands (MCP Tool)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

Found in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/dynamic_cli.rs`:

### Lines 387-388 (Workflows Section):
```rust
let separator_text = format!("──────── WORKFLOWS ──────── | {}", about);
*first = first.clone().about(intern_string(separator_text));
```

### Lines 412 (Tools Section):
```rust
modified_data.about = Some(format!("──────── TOOLS ──────── | {}", about));
```

**The issue**: Visual separators are being added to the `.about()` text of the first command in each section. This was a workaround for Clap v4.x not supporting multiple `next_help_heading()` calls for subcommands.

## Proposed Solution

Remove the visual separator workaround and use Clap's built-in `next_help_heading()` functionality properly. While Clap v4.x has limitations with subcommand headings, the correct approach is to:

1. Remove visual separators from command descriptions entirely
2. Use `next_help_heading()` before adding each group of subcommands
3. Accept Clap's default behavior where all subcommands appear under "Commands:" heading

This means the final output will be:
```
Commands:
  serve            Run as MCP server
  doctor           Diagnose configuration and setup issues
  
  # Workflow shortcuts
  implement        Autonomously run until all issues are resolved (shortcut for 'flow implement')
  plan             Turn specifications into multiple step plans (shortcut for 'flow plan')
  
  # Tool commands
  file             FILE management commands (MCP Tool)
  issue            ISSUE management commands (MCP Tool)
```

The commands will all be under "Commands:" but will be visually grouped by blank lines and clear descriptions indicating they are shortcuts or tool commands.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Remove workflow separator code (Lines 384-390) ✅
Remove the code that adds the visual separator to the first workflow command:
```rust
// DELETE:
if let Some(first) = shortcuts.first_mut() {
    if let Some(about) = first.get_about() {
        let separator_text = format!("──────── WORKFLOWS ──────── | {}", about);
        *first = first.clone().about(intern_string(separator_text));
    }
}
```

### 2. Remove tools separator code (Lines 408-414) ✅
Remove the code that adds the visual separator to the first tool command:
```rust
// DELETE:
let mut modified_data = category_data.clone();
if index == 0 {
    if let Some(about) = &modified_data.about {
        modified_data.about = Some(format!("──────── TOOLS ──────── | {}", about));
    }
}

// REPLACE WITH:
let modified_data = category_data.clone();
```

### 3. Update tests in dynamic_cli_tests.rs ✅
Remove tests that verify separator presence:
- Remove assertions checking for "──────── WORKFLOWS ────────"
- Remove assertions checking for "──────── TOOLS ────────"
- Add new tests to verify clean command descriptions

### 4. Update comments ✅
Remove comments referencing the visual separator workaround (lines 374-378, 397-400).

## Files Modified

1. `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/dynamic_cli.rs` - Removed separator code and obsolete comments
2. `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/dynamic_cli_tests.rs` - Replaced separator tests with clean description test

## Test Results

```
cargo nextest run -p swissarmyhammer-cli
Summary [  22.210s] 1203 tests run: 1203 passed, 1 skipped
```

All tests pass!

## Help Output Verification

The help output now displays cleanly without visual separators:

```
Commands:
  serve            Run as MCP server (default when invoked via stdio)
  doctor           Diagnose configuration and setup issues
  prompt           Manage and test prompts
  flow             Execute and manage workflows
  validate         Validate prompt files and workflows for syntax and best practices
  plan             Plan a specific specification file
  implement        Execute the implement workflow for autonomous issue resolution
  agent            Manage and interact with agents
  rule             Manage and test code quality rules
  _implement       Autonomously run until all issues are resolved (shortcut for 'flow implement')
  _plan            Turn specifications into multiple step plans (shortcut for 'flow plan')
  ...
  file             FILE management commands (MCP Tool)
  issue            ISSUE management commands (MCP Tool)
  memo             MEMO management commands (MCP Tool)
```
