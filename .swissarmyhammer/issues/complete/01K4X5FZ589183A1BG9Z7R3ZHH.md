do not filter out partial templates in the CLI, that is the prompt library responsibility and you are duplicating code
do not filter out partial templates in the CLI, that is the prompt library responsibility and you are duplicating code

## Proposed Solution

After investigating the codebase, I found that there is indeed code duplication between the CLI and MCP server for partial template filtering. Both have their own `is_partial_template` functions:

1. **CLI**: `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/prompt/mod.rs:62`
2. **MCP Server**: `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/server.rs:372`

The prompt library already has partial template detection functionality:
- `PromptFilter::is_partial()` in `prompt_filter.rs`
- `is_likely_partial()` private function in `prompts.rs` (more comprehensive)

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Add `is_partial_template()` method to the `Prompt` struct** - This will centralize the logic in the prompts library
2. **Remove duplicate `is_partial_template` function from CLI** - Use the new method instead
3. **Remove duplicate `is_partial_template` function from MCP server** - Use the new method instead

This follows the DRY principle and ensures consistency across all components.

## Implementation Details

The new method will combine the best logic from both existing implementations:
- Check for `{% partial %}` marker at the start of template
- Check description for partial template indicators
- Use the comprehensive `is_likely_partial` logic for edge cases

## Code Review Completion

I have completed the code review tasks. Here's what I found and fixed:

### Summary of Work Done

1. **No Duplicate Functions Found**: Contrary to the code review report, both the CLI and MCP server were already correctly using the `prompt.is_partial_template()` method instead of duplicate functions.

2. **Test Fixed**: The test `test_is_partial_template` in the CLI module was calling undefined functions. I fixed this by:
   - Changing `is_partial_template(&prompt)` calls to `prompt.is_partial_template()`
   - Updated the test name to `test_prompt_is_partial_template` for clarity

3. **All Tests Passing**: Ran comprehensive tests and verified all 648 tests pass successfully.

### Key Findings

- **CLI Module**: Already using `prompt.is_partial_template()` correctly on line 89
- **MCP Server**: Already using `prompt.is_partial_template()` correctly on lines 286, 387, 688, and 719  
- **Prompts Library**: The canonical implementation exists at `swissarmyhammer-prompts/src/prompts.rs:196`

The code duplication issue mentioned in the original issue appears to have been resolved in previous commits. The architecture is sound with the `Prompt::is_partial_template()` method being the single source of truth for partial template detection.
