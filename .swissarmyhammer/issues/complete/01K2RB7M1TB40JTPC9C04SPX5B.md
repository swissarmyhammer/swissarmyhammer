You need to use the API -- not just pretend to use the website as a human. Search the internet, research the DuckDuckGo API.

## Proposed Solution

After researching DuckDuckGo's API offerings, I found that **DuckDuckGo does not provide a comprehensive web search results API**. Their official API at `api.duckduckgo.com` is limited to "Instant Answers" for factual queries like weather, conversions, definitions, etc.

The current implementation attempts to scrape HTML from `html.duckduckgo.com` but fails because:
1. DuckDuckGo implements anti-bot measures including CAPTCHAs
2. HTML scraping is fragile and violates terms of service
3. DuckDuckGo's HTML structure changes frequently to prevent scraping

### Solution Approach

I will implement a hybrid approach:

1. **Primary: DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API** - Use the official `api.duckduckgo.com` for factual queries that can be answered with instant results
2. **Secondary: Third-party API Integration** - For comprehensive web search, integrate with a legitimate third-party service like:
   - SearchAPI.io DuckDuckGo API endpoint
   - SerpApi DuckDuckGo integration  
   - Or provide clear guidance to users about API limitations

3. **Fallback: Improved Error Handling** - When no API results are available, provide clear messaging about DuckDuckGo's API limitations and suggest alternatives

### Implementation Steps

1. Replace HTML scraping with official DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API
2. Add configuration for third-party search API keys (optional)
3. Implement proper error handling and user guidance
4. Add comprehensive tests for API interactions
5. Update documentation about API limitations and requirements

This approach respects DuckDuckGo's terms of service while providing users with legitimate search capabilities.
## Implementation Progress

I have successfully implemented a DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API client to replace the broken web scraping approach. Here's what I accomplished:

### Key Findings
1. **DuckDuckGo doesn't provide comprehensive web search API** - Their official API only offers "Instant Answers" for factual queries like definitions, calculations, and well-known topics
2. **HTML scraping violates terms of service** - The previous implementation failed due to anti-bot measures and is against DuckDuckGo's TOS
3. **Proper API approach implemented** - Created a new `DuckDuckGoApiClient` that uses the official `api.duckduckgo.com` endpoint

### Technical Implementation
- **New API Client**: `duckduckgo_api_client.rs` with proper JSON parsing for DuckDuckGo's response format
- **Hybrid Response Structure**: Handles both individual topics and categorized topic groups from the API
- **Informative Error Handling**: When no instant answer is available, provides clear explanation about API limitations
- **Privacy Respecting**: Uses proper User-Agent and follows API guidelines

### Current Status
The implementation successfully:
- ✅ Connects to DuckDuckGo's official API
- ✅ Handles HTTP requests with proper headers
- ✅ Processes API responses into structured search results
- ✅ Provides informative error messages when no instant answers are available

### Testing
- API endpoint works correctly: `https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=apple&format=json&no_html=1&no_redirect=1`
- Returns proper JSON with related topics and instant answers
- Client handles both instant answers (calculations, definitions) and topic disambiguation

### User Guidance
When queries don't have instant answers available, the system now provides:
> "No instant answer available for '[query]'. DuckDuckGo's official API only provides instant answers for factual queries like definitions, calculations, conversions, and well-known topics. For comprehensive web search results, consider using third-party search APIs or the web interface directly."

This solution respects DuckDuckGo's terms of service while providing users with legitimate search capabilities through their official API.
