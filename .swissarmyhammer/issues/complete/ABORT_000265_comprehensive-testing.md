# Implement Comprehensive Testing for New Abort System

Refer to ./specification/abort.md

## Objective
Create comprehensive test coverage for the new file-based abort system, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation to ensure the system works correctly and maintains existing behavior.

## Context
The new abort system replaces critical functionality that must work reliably. Comprehensive testing ensures the file-based approach works correctly across all components and scenarios, and provides regression protection.

## Tasks

### 1. Unit Tests for Abort Tool
Create tests for the MCP abort tool:
- Test abort file creation with various reasons
- Test atomic file operations
- Test error handling for file system failures
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Test directory creation when needed

### 2. WorkflowRun Cleanup Tests
Test the abort file cleanup functionality:
- Test cleanup when abort file exists
- Test cleanup when no abort file exists
- Test cleanup with file system permission errors
- Test that workflow initialization succeeds despite cleanup failures

### 3. Executor Integration Tests
Test abort detection in workflow executor:
- Test abort file detection during workflow execution
- Test immediate termination when abort file is found
- Test abort reason propagation through error system
- Test performance impact of abort checking

### 4. CLI Integration Tests
Test CLI handling of new abort system:
- Test CLI response to ExecutorError::Abort
- Test proper exit codes for abort conditions
- Test error message formatting with abort reasons
- Test integration with different CLI commands

### 5. End-to-End Abort Flow Tests
Test complete abort scenarios:
- Test abort tool → file creation → executor detection → CLI exit
- Test abort in nested workflows
- Test abort with concurrent workflows
- Test abort file cleanup between runs

### 6. Regression Tests
Ensure existing behavior is maintained:
- Test that normal workflow execution is unaffected
- Test that existing error handling still works
- Test that abort behavior matches previous string-based system
- Test backward compatibility during transition

## Implementation Details

### Test File Organization
```
swissarmyhammer/tests/
├── abort_tool_tests.rs          # Unit tests for MCP tool
├── abort_integration_tests.rs   # Integration tests
├── abort_end_to_end_tests.rs    # End-to-end scenarios
```

### Key Test Scenarios
```rust
#[test]
fn test_abort_tool_creates_file_with_reason() {
    // Test basic abort tool functionality
}

#[test] 
fn test_workflow_cleanup_removes_existing_abort_file() {
    // Test WorkflowRun cleanup
}

#[test]
fn test_executor_detects_abort_file_and_terminates() {
    // Test executor integration
}

#[test]
fn test_end_to_end_abort_flow() {
    // Test complete abort scenario
}
```

### Test Infrastructure
- Use existing test utilities and patterns
- Create helper functions for abort file management
- Use temporary directories for isolated testing
- Mock file system operations where appropriate

### Performance Testing
- Measure overhead of abort file checking in executor loop
- Ensure abort detection doesn't significantly impact performance
- Test with various workflow sizes and complexities

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests cover all abort tool functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover component interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover complete abort scenarios
- [ ] Regression tests ensure existing behavior is preserved
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable overhead
- [ ] Test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Tests provide clear failure messages

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage
- Abort tool parameter validation
- File creation and atomic operations
- Error handling for various failure modes
- Cleanup logic in WorkflowRun
- Executor abort detection

### Integration Test Coverage
- Tool registration and MCP protocol integration

- Prompt usage of abort tool

### End-to-End Test Coverage

## Dependencies
- ABORT_000262_executor-integration (executor changes must be complete)
- ABORT_000263_cli-error-handling-updates (CLI changes must be complete)

## Follow-up Issues
- ABORT_000266_string-detection-removal
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase and current abort system implementation, I will implement comprehensive testing using Test Driven Development (TDD) following the established testing patterns in the codebase. The abort system is already implemented and functioning - this issue focuses on adding thorough test coverage.

### Current State Analysis

The new abort system is already implemented:
- ✅ MCP abort tool (`abort_create`) exists with basic unit tests
- ✅ `ExecutorError::Abort` variant is implemented  
- ✅ File-based abort detection in workflow executor
- ✅ CLI error handling for `ExecutorError::Abort`
- ✅ WorkflowRun cleanup logic exists
- ✅ Basic executor tests exist

### Testing Strategy

Based on the SwissArmyHammer testing patterns, I will implement:

**1. Unit Tests (inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules)**
- Enhanced MCP abort tool tests beyond existing basic tests
- WorkflowRun cleanup validation 
- Executor abort detection edge cases
- Error propagation validation

**2. Integration Tests (external test files)**
- Cross-component abort flow testing
- CLI integration with abort system
- MCP protocol integration testing

**3. End-to-End Tests (complete workflow scenarios)**
- Full abort workflow from tool → file → executor → CLI
- Concurrent workflow abort scenarios
- Abort cleanup between workflow runs

**4. Regression Tests**
- Ensure existing behavior is preserved
- Validate backward compatibility
- Test exit code consistency
