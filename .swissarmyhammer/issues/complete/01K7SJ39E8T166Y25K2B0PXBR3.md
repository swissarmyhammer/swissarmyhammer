# Remove notify_create from Documentation - Features

## Parent Issue
Eliminate notify_create Tool and Replace with Native MCP Notifications (01K7SM38449JYA2KZP4KNKQ05X)

## Summary
Remove notify_create tool from features documentation.

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-tools/doc/src/features.md` (around line 304)

## Tasks

1. Remove the "Notification System" section:
```markdown
### Notification System

Send notifications from AI to user through the logging system.

**Tool**: `notify_create`

- Send info, warning, or error notifications
- Include structured context data
- Rate-limited for safety
- Useful for alerting users during long operations
```

2. If there are other notification features (like MCP progress notifications), update the section to describe those instead

## Alternative

If we're adding MCP progress notifications, replace the content with:
```markdown
### Progress Notifications

Tools send real-time progress updates during long-running operations via MCP notifications.

**Features**:
- Streaming progress updates for shell commands
- File indexing progress with percentage complete
- Web search and fetch progress
- No LLM tool calls required - server-sent automatically

See [Progress Notifications](./architecture/progress-notifications.md) for details.
```

## Dependencies

Must be completed **after**:
- Remove notify_create from Tool Registry
- Phase 1: Implement MCP Progress Notification Infrastructure (01K7SHZ4203SMD2C6HTW1QV3ZP)

## Verification

- [ ] notify_create references removed from features.md
- [ ] MCP progress notifications documented (if implemented)
- [ ] `mdbook build swissarmyhammer-tools/doc/` succeeds



## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the features.md file, I found that:

1. **The notify_create section has already been removed** - There is no "Notification System" section in the file
2. **No notify_create references exist** - A grep search confirms zero matches for "notify_create" in features.md
3. **The current file is clean** - All feature sections are focused on existing tools without notification references

### Analysis

The features.md file currently documents these sections:
- File Tools
- Semantic Search  
- Issue Management
- Memo System
- Todo Tracking
- Git Integration
- Shell Execution
- Code Outline
- Rules Engine
- Web Tools
- Workflow Execution
- Abort Mechanism

There is no Notification System section, which means this cleanup was already completed in a previous refactoring (likely commit ca8f3630 or 4b8c50f2 based on the git history).

### Decision

Since the notify_create tool has already been removed from features.md, this issue appears to be **already complete**. However, I should verify:

1. Check if MCP progress notifications are implemented and should be documented
2. Check the progress-notifications.md file mentioned in the alternative solution
3. Verify mdbook build succeeds

If MCP progress notifications exist but aren't documented, I'll add that section to features.md as suggested in the alternative approach.

### Next Steps

1. Search for MCP progress notification implementation in the codebase
2. Check if progress-notifications.md exists
3. Determine if progress notifications should be documented in features.md
4. Run mdbook build to verify documentation builds correctly




## Investigation Results

### Completed Verification Tasks

1. ✅ **notify_create already removed** - The features.md file has no references to notify_create or "Notification System" section
2. ✅ **MCP progress notifications ARE implemented** - Found implementation in:
   - `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/progress_notifications.rs` - Full infrastructure with ProgressNotification, ProgressSender, channels
   - `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/notifications.rs` - Integration layer
   - `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/notify/mod.rs` - Confirms replacement of old notify_create
3. ✅ **Progress notifications partially documented** - Found in `tools.md` under flow tool but NOT in `features.md`
4. ✅ **mdbook build succeeds** - Documentation builds without errors

### Decision: Add Progress Notifications to features.md

Since MCP progress notifications are fully implemented and working, they SHOULD be documented in features.md as a feature. Currently, they're only mentioned in the flow tool documentation in tools.md.

### Implementation Plan

Following the issue's "Alternative" suggestion, I will:

1. Add a new "Progress Notifications" section to features.md
2. Position it appropriately in the feature list (likely after "Workflow Execution" since flow tools use it)
3. Use the suggested content with appropriate modifications based on actual implementation




## Implementation Complete

### Changes Made

1. **Added Progress Notifications section** to `features.md` after the Workflow Execution section
   - Documented key capabilities (async delivery, ULID tokens, progress percentages, metadata support)
   - Explained how it works (MCP protocol, automatic updates, no polling needed)
   - Provided example progress flow
   - Listed tools that currently use progress notifications

2. **Updated Overview section** to include Progress Notifications in the feature list

3. **Verified mdbook build** - Documentation builds successfully without errors

### Files Modified

- `/Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/swissarmyhammer-tools/doc/src/features.md`

### Content Added

The new section includes:
- Overview of real-time progress updates via MCP notifications
- Key capabilities (streaming updates, percentage tracking, workflow state transitions)
- Technical details (channel-based async, ULID tokens, custom metadata)
- Example progress flow showing typical operation lifecycle
- List of tools currently using progress notifications

### Verification

✅ notify_create references removed (already done in previous commit)
✅ MCP progress notifications documented in features.md
✅ `mdbook build` succeeds without errors

### Notes

The original task to "remove notify_create from features.md" was already completed in a previous refactoring. This implementation focused on the "Alternative" path: adding documentation for the MCP progress notifications that replaced notify_create.

The implementation is based on the actual code in:
- `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/progress_notifications.rs` (main infrastructure)
- `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/notifications.rs` (integration)
- References in `tools.md` for the flow tool
