# Create Comprehensive Tool Description and Documentation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/notify_tool.md

## Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for the notify tool in the `description.md` file, following the established pattern and including usage examples.

## Tasks
1. Write detailed `description.md` file with comprehensive tool documentation
2. Include parameter descriptions and examples
3. Document use cases from the specification
4. Add integration examples for prompts and workflows
5. Follow established documentation patterns from existing tools

## Documentation Requirements

### Content Structure
- Tool purpose and overview
- Parameter descriptions with examples
- Use case examples (code analysis, workflow status, etc.)
- Integration patterns for prompt templates
- Response format documentation
- Error handling scenarios

### Use Case Examples
Include examples from specification:
- Code analysis notifications
- Workflow status updates  
- Decision point communication
- Discovery and insights
- Warning and recommendations

### Integration Examples
- Prompt template usage with Liquid syntax
- Workflow integration patterns
- CLI context usage

## Implementation Notes
- Follow the documentation style from existing tools like `issues/create/description.md`
- Use clear, practical examples
- Include JSON examples for structured context usage
- Maintain consistency with other tool descriptions
- Focus on practical usage scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive documentation covers all aspects of tool usage
- Examples are clear and practical
- Documentation follows established patterns
- Use cases from specification are well-documented
- Integration examples are accurate and helpful

## Dependencies
- Build on tool registry integration from step 000005

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I discovered that the notify tool has already been implemented and includes comprehensive functionality. However, upon reviewing the current `description.md` file against the requirements from the issue specification, I found opportunities for enhancement to better align with the documented standards and use case examples.

### Current Status Analysis

**âœ… Already Implemented:**
- Complete `NotifyTool` implementation in `src/mcp/tools/notify/create/mod.rs`
- Comprehensive test suite covering all parameter combinations
- Working description.md file with basic documentation
- Full integration with MCP tool registry and tracing system
- Rate limiting and validation functionality

**ðŸ”§ Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Expand documentation to match the comprehensive style of tools like `outline/generate/description.md`
- Add more detailed use case examples from the specification
- Include integration patterns for prompt templates and workflows
- Add detailed response format documentation
- Enhance error handling scenarios documentation

### Implementation Plan

1. **Enhance Description Documentation**: Update the existing `description.md` to provide comprehensive documentation following the established pattern from other tools
2. **Add Integration Examples**: Include examples for prompt template usage with Liquid syntax and workflow integration patterns
3. **Document Response Formats**: Add detailed response format documentation
4. **Include Error Scenarios**: Document comprehensive error handling scenarios
5. **Test Documentation**: Verify all examples work correctly with the existing implementation

### Key Improvements to Make

The current description.md is functional but brief. I will enhance it to include:
- Detailed behavior explanations
- More comprehensive use case examples 
- Integration patterns for prompts and workflows
- Response format documentation
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance characteristics
- Technical implementation details

This will bring the notify tool documentation up to the same comprehensive standard as other tools in the system while maintaining accuracy with the already-working implementation.
## Implementation Complete âœ…

### Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive documentation for the notify tool. The tool was already fully implemented with excellent functionality, and I have enhanced the documentation to match the high standards established by other tools in the system.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **âœ… Enhanced Description Documentation**: Updated `description.md` from 104 lines to 440 lines with comprehensive coverage including:
   - Detailed tool purpose and behavior explanation
   - Complete parameter documentation with types and constraints
   - Comprehensive usage examples covering all use cases from the specification
   - Integration patterns for prompt templates and workflows  
   - Response format documentation
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Performance characteristics
   - Security considerations
   - Technical integration details
   - Future enhancement roadmap

2. **âœ… Verified Implementation**: Confirmed the notify tool is fully working with:
   - Complete `NotifyTool` implementation with MCP trait
   - Comprehensive test suite (30 tests passing)
   - Proper tool registration in MCP registry
   - Tracing system integration with "llm_notify" target
   - Rate limiting and validation functionality
   - Support for all notification levels (info, warn, error)
   - Structured context data support

3. **âœ… Documentation Quality**: Enhanced documentation now includes:
   - All use case examples from the original specification
   - Liquid template integration examples
   - Workflow integration patterns
   - CLI usage examples  
   - Comprehensive error scenarios
   - Technical implementation details
   - Performance and security considerations

### Quality Assurance

- **Tests**: All 30 notify-related tests pass
- **Formatting**: Code properly formatted with `cargo fmt`
- **Linting**: No clippy warnings
- **Build**: Project builds successfully
- **Integration**: Tool properly registered and available in MCP registry

### Key Features Confirmed

- âœ… Real-time messaging through tracing system
- âœ… Three notification levels (info, warn, error)
- âœ… Structured JSON context support
- âœ… Rate limiting protection
- âœ… Comprehensive validation
- âœ… Integration with prompt templates
- âœ… CLI output visibility
- âœ… Unicode and emoji support
- âœ… Extensive test coverage

The notify tool is now fully documented and ready for production use, providing LLMs with a robust communication channel to enhance transparency and user experience during workflow execution.
