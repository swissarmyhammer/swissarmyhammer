# Performance Optimization and Benchmarking

## Problem
The specification emphasizes following successful Rust CLIs like `uv` with startup time < 50ms, but there's no evidence of performance testing or optimization in the current implementation.

## Requirements from Specification
- Startup time < 50ms (like successful Rust CLIs)
- Performance-first approach
- Benchmark against other tools

## Current State
- Build time is ~14 seconds in dev mode
- No performance benchmarks exist
- Startup time hasn't been measured or optimized

## Tasks
- [ ] Add startup time benchmarking
- [ ] Optimize binary size and startup performance
- [ ] Create benchmarks comparing against other MCP servers
- [ ] Profile prompt loading and template processing performance
- [ ] Add release build optimizations
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cargo bench` for systematic benchmarking
- Profile with tools like `perf` or `cargo flamegraph`
- Consider lazy loading of prompts for faster startup
- Optimize dependencies and compilation settings
- Benchmark against other popular Rust CLIs for baseline comparison

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Startup time consistently < 50ms in release builds
- [ ] Comprehensive benchmark suite
- [ ] Performance regression testing in CI
- [ ] Documented performance characteristics
- [ ] Optimized for common use cases (MCP server startup, prompt listing)
