# Core Shell Execution Engine Implementation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-shell/ideas/shell.md

## Overview

Implement the core shell command execution engine with proper process management, timeout controls, and output capture following the specification requirements.

## Objective

Build the fundamental command execution functionality using `std::process::Command` with comprehensive output capture, exit code handling, and basic error management.

## Requirements

### Command Execution Core
- Use `std::process::Command` for process spawning
- Capture both stdout and stderr streams
- Preserve and return exit codes
- Handle command execution in async context using tokio

### Output Management
- Capture complete stdout and stderr output
- Handle both text and binary output gracefully
- Preserve output ordering and timing
- Return structured output in the response

### Error Handling
- Handle process spawn failures
- Distinguish between execution errors and command failures
- Provide detailed error messages with context
- Return appropriate error responses via MCP protocol

### Basic Response Structure
Implement the response format from specification:
- Successful execution with metadata
- Command failures with exit codes
- Basic error conditions
- Execution timing information

## Implementation Details

### Core Function Signature
```rust
pub async fn execute_shell_command(
    command: String,
    working_directory: Option<PathBuf>,
    timeout_seconds: u64,
    environment: Option<HashMap<String, String>>,
) -> Result<ShellExecutionResult, ShellError>
```

### Response Structure
```rust
pub struct ShellExecutionResult {
    pub command: String,
    pub exit_code: i32,
    pub stdout: String,
    pub stderr: String,
    pub execution_time_ms: u64,
    pub working_directory: PathBuf,
}
```

### Error Types
Create comprehensive error types:
- `CommandSpawnError`: Failed to start process
- `ExecutionError`: Runtime execution failures
- `InvalidCommand`: Command validation failures
- `SystemError`: System-level issues

## Architecture Patterns

### Async Integration
- Use tokio for async process execution
- Ensure proper async context throughout
- Handle async cancellation gracefully
- Follow existing async patterns in the codebase

### Error Propagation
- Use the established `Result<T, E>` patterns
- Integrate with existing error hierarchy
- Provide rich error context and details
- Follow the error handling patterns from other tools

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Basic command execution works with std::process::Command
- [ ] Stdout and stderr captured correctly
- [ ] Exit codes preserved and returned
- [ ] Async execution integrated properly
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive and informative
- [ ] Response structure matches specification format
- [ ] Integration tests pass with basic commands
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable for command output

## Notes

- This step focuses on the core execution without timeout or security features
- Working directory and environment variable support included but basic
- Timeout will be added in the next step for proper process management
- Security validation will be handled in a separate step
- Focus on correctness and reliability of basic execution

## Analysis

I've examined the existing shell tool infrastructure and found:

### Current Implementation Status
- Shell tool infrastructure is partially implemented with proper MCP integration
- Tool registration, parameter validation, and error handling are complete
- The actual command execution logic is stubbed out - this is the focus of this issue

### Existing Implementation Strengths
- Complete MCP tool structure in `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/shell/execute/mod.rs`
- Proper JSON schema validation for all parameters (command, working_directory, timeout, environment)
- Rate limiting and input validation already implemented
- Comprehensive test suite for parameter validation and error cases
- Tool is registered in the MCP server but only returns placeholder responses

### What Needs Implementation
The core command execution engine is the missing piece. Currently line 121-134 in `execute/mod.rs` contains a placeholder that returns:
```rust
// For now, return a placeholder response indicating the infrastructure is ready
// The actual command execution will be implemented in subsequent issues
```

This issue needs to implement the actual shell command execution using `std::process::Command` as specified.

## Proposed Solution

I will implement the core shell execution engine with the following approach:

### 1. Command Execution Core
- Replace the placeholder with `std::process::Command` execution
- Implement async command execution using `tokio::process::Command`
- Capture stdout and stderr streams in real-time
- Return proper exit codes and execution metadata

### 2. Response Structure Implementation
- Create proper `ShellExecutionResult` struct matching the specification
- Return structured metadata including execution time, exit codes, and output
- Handle both successful and failed command execution cases

### 3. Working Directory and Environment Support
- Implement working directory changes using `current_dir()`
- Add environment variable support using `envs()`
- Validate directory paths and environment variables

### 4. Error Handling Enhancement
- Create comprehensive error types for different failure modes
- Handle process spawn failures, execution errors, and system issues
- Provide detailed error context in MCP responses

### 5. Test-Driven Development Approach
- Write failing tests for actual command execution
- Implement functionality to make tests pass
- Add integration tests with real commands
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of success and failure cases

The implementation will follow the existing codebase patterns and integrate seamlessly with the current MCP infrastructure.
