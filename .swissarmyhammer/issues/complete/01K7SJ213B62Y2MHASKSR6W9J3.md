# Delete notify_create Integration Tests

## Parent Issue
Eliminate notify_create Tool and Replace with Native MCP Notifications (01K7SM38449JYA2KZP4KNKQ05X)

## Summary
Delete the integration test file for notify_create tool.

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-tools/tests/notify_integration_tests.rs`

## Tasks

1. Delete the entire file: `swissarmyhammer-tools/tests/notify_integration_tests.rs`
   - Contains ~350+ lines of tests for notify_create tool
   - Includes tests for:
     - Tool registration
     - Tool execution with various parameters
     - Validation errors
     - Different notification levels
     - Complex context handling
     - Unicode and special characters
     - Error recovery
     - Rate limiting
     - Resource cleanup
     - Realistic usage scenarios

2. Verify tests pass after deletion
   - Run `cargo nextest run --fail-fast`
   - Ensure no other tests depend on this file

## Dependencies

Must be completed **after**:
- Remove notify_create from Tool Registry

## Verification

- [x] File deleted
- [x] `cargo nextest run --fail-fast` succeeds
- [x] No test failures from missing dependencies

## Resolution

The integration test file `swissarmyhammer-tools/tests/notify_integration_tests.rs` does not exist in the codebase. The file was removed as part of the parent issue work to remove the notify_create tool.

### Verification Steps
1. Confirm file deletion - file does not exist at expected path
2. Search codebase for any references to `notify_integration_tests` - only found in issue tracking files
3. Run full test suite to verify no broken test dependencies

### Implementation Notes

**Status Check:** The file is absent from the codebase. Only references exist in issue tracking markdown files in `.swissarmyhammer/issues/` directories.

**Test Results:** All 3316 tests pass successfully with no failures related to the deleted integration test file.

### Conclusion

The task specified in this issue is complete. The integration test file for notify_create is removed, and the test suite runs cleanly without it.
