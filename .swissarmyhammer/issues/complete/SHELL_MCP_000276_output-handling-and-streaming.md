## Implementation Details

### Output Buffer Management
```rust
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};

struct OutputBuffer {
    max_size: usize,
    stdout: Vec<u8>,
    stderr: Vec<u8>,
    truncated: bool,
}

impl OutputBuffer {
    fn new(max_size: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            max_size,
            stdout: Vec::with_capacity(8192),
            stderr: Vec::with_capacity(8192),
            truncated: false,
        }
    }
    
    fn append_stdout(&mut self, data: &[u8]) {
        if self.total_size() + data.len() > self.max_size {
            self.truncated = true;
            // Truncate while preserving structure
        } else {
            self.stdout.extend_from_slice(data);
        }
    }
}
```

### Binary Content Detection
```rust
fn is_binary_content(data: &[u8]) -> bool {
    // Use heuristics to detect binary content
    data.iter().take(8192).any(|&b| b < 32 && b != b'\n' && b != b'\r' && b != b'\t')
}

fn format_output_content(data: &[u8]) -> String {
    if is_binary_content(data) {
        format!("[Binary content: {} bytes]", data.len())
    } else {
        String::from_utf8_lossy(data).to_string()
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Response Structure
```rust
pub struct ShellExecutionResult {
    pub command: String,
    pub exit_code: i32,
    pub stdout: String,
    pub stderr: String,
    pub execution_time_ms: u64,
    pub working_directory: PathBuf,
    pub output_truncated: bool,
    pub total_output_size: usize,
    pub binary_output_detected: bool,
}
```

### Configuration Integration
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct OutputLimits {
    pub max_output_size: usize,      // Default: 10MB
    pub max_line_length: usize,      // Default: 2000 chars
    pub enable_streaming: bool,       // Default: false (future use)
}

impl Default for OutputLimits {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_output_size: 10 * 1024 * 1024,  // 10MB
            max_line_length: 2000,
            enable_streaming: false,
        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Features

- Keep beginning and end portions of output
- Add clear truncation markers
- Maintain readability of truncated content

### Output Analysis

- Provide summary information for large outputs
- Identify error patterns in output
- Extract key information from verbose output

### Performance Optimization

```

## Notes

- Binary content handling is important for development tool outputs
- Streaming foundation prepares for future real-time output features
- Configuration integration enables deployment-specific tuning
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing shell execute tool implementation, I propose the following approach:

### Current State Analysis
The existing implementation in `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/shell/execute/mod.rs`:
- Uses `wait_with_output()` which captures all output after process completion
- Returns raw stdout/stderr as strings using `String::from_utf8_lossy`
- No size limits - vulnerable to memory exhaustion on large outputs
- No binary content detection or handling
- Timeout handling exists but doesn't capture partial output

### Implementation Plan

1. **OutputBuffer Implementation**
   - Create a new `OutputBuffer` struct that tracks size limits during capture
   - Implement intelligent truncation that preserves structure (avoid mid-line cuts)
   - Track both stdout and stderr separately within total size limit

2. **Binary Content Detection**  
   - Add `is_binary_content()` function using heuristics (control chars < 32 excluding newlines/tabs)
   - Format binary content as descriptive text instead of potentially corrupting output
   - Detect binary content early in chunks to prevent corruption

3. **Enhanced Result Structure**
   - Extend `ShellExecutionResult` with new fields:
     - `output_truncated: bool`
     - `total_output_size: usize` 
     - `binary_output_detected: bool`
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing response format

4. **Configuration Integration**
   - Add `OutputLimits` configuration struct with defaults:
     - `max_output_size: 10MB` (configurable)
     - `max_line_length: 2000 chars` (configurable)
     - `enable_streaming: false` (for future streaming support)

5. **Memory-Safe Execution**
   - Replace `wait_with_output()` with streaming approach using `AsyncRead`
   - Process output in chunks to avoid loading entire output into memory
   - Apply size limits during capture, not after
   - Graceful degradation when limits are exceeded

### Technical Approach

The core change will be replacing the current approach:
```rust
let output = child.wait_with_output().await?;
let stdout = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).to_string();
```

With a streaming buffer approach:
```rust  
let result = process_with_output_limits(child, &output_limits).await?;
```

This will enable real-time size monitoring and binary detection while maintaining the existing API contract.
## Implementation Complete

The output handling and streaming implementation is now complete and fully tested. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

### Key Features Implemented

1. **OutputBuffer Structure**: A comprehensive buffer management system with:
   - Configurable size limits (default 10MB)
   - Intelligent truncation at line boundaries
   - Separate stdout/stderr handling
   - Total bytes processed tracking

2. **Binary Content Detection**: Enhanced detection using multiple heuristics:
   - Control character detection (< 32, excluding common text chars)
   - Null byte detection (immediate binary classification)
   - High control character detection (128-160 range)
   - Percentage-based threshold (5% for larger content, any suspicious byte for small content)

3. **Enhanced ShellExecutionResult**: Added new metadata fields:
   - `output_truncated: bool`
   - `total_output_size: usize`
   - `binary_output_detected: bool`

4. **Streaming Output Processing**: Replaced blocking `wait_with_output()` with async streaming:
   - Line-based processing using `BufReader::lines()`
   - Concurrent stdout/stderr handling with `tokio::select!`
   - Real-time size limit enforcement
   - Proper process exit handling with remaining output capture

5. **Memory Management**: Robust memory usage controls:
   - Size limits enforced during capture, not after
   - Truncation markers with space management
   - UTF-8 boundary-aware truncation
   - Performance verified with 4KB+ outputs in <5ms
