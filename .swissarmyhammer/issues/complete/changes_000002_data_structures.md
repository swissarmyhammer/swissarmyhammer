# Step 2: Define Request and Response Data Structures

Refer to ideas/changes.md

## Objective

Create the data structures for the git_changes tool request and response.

## Tasks

1. Define `GitChangesRequest` struct
   - `branch: String` - Branch name to analyze
   - Add serde derives for JSON serialization
   - Add documentation

2. Define `GitChangesResponse` struct
   - `branch: String` - The analyzed branch
   - `parent_branch: Option<String>` - Parent branch if determined
   - `files: Vec<String>` - List of changed file paths
   - Add serde derives for JSON serialization
   - Add documentation

3. Add unit tests for serialization/deserialization

## Success Criteria

- Structs compile and serialize/deserialize correctly
- Tests pass with `cargo nextest run`
- Documentation is complete

## Files to Modify

- `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/git/changes/mod.rs`

## Estimated Code Changes

~60 lines

## Proposed Solution

The data structures have already been implemented in the module scaffolding from the previous issue. No additional work is needed.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All requirements have been met:

### GitChangesRequest
- ✅ `branch: String` field with documentation
- ✅ Serde derives: `#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]`
- ✅ Documentation comments present

### GitChangesResponse
- ✅ `branch: String` field with documentation
- ✅ `parent_branch: Option<String>` field with documentation
- ✅ `files: Vec<String>` field with documentation
- ✅ Serde derives: `#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]`
- ✅ Documentation comments present

### Unit Tests
- ✅ `test_git_changes_request_serialization` - Validates JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ `test_git_changes_response_serialization` - Validates JSON serialization/deserialization with all fields

### Test Results
```
cargo nextest run git_changes
Summary: 6 tests run: 6 passed
```

All tests pass successfully, confirming that:
- Structs compile correctly
- Serialization/deserialization works as expected
- Documentation is complete

## Files Modified
- `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/git/changes/mod.rs` (already implemented)

## Verification

Verified on branch: `issue/changes_000002_data_structures`
- All data structures meet specification
- All tests pass
- No additional code changes required
