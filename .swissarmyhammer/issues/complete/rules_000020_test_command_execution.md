# Add Real LLM Execution to Test Command

Refer to ideas/rules.md

## Goal

Complete the test command by adding real LLM execution (Phase 5) and result parsing (Phase 6).

## Context

This is the critical part that actually executes the check via LLM so rule authors can see real results.

## Implementation Notes

### Actual Problem Solved

The issue description suggested that LLM execution needed to be added, but the code already had complete LLM execution implemented in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/test.rs`. The **real issue** was that the `rule` command wasn't registered in the CLI.

### Changes Made

1. **Added `build_rule_command()` method** in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/dynamic_cli.rs:1138-1404`
   - Created complete CLI definition with all subcommands (list, validate, check, test)
   - Added comprehensive help text and examples
   - Followed the same pattern as `build_prompt_command()` and `build_flow_command()`
   - Made method public for testing

2. **Registered rule command** in `add_static_commands()` at line 744
   - Added `cli = cli.subcommand(Self::build_rule_command());`
   - Rule command now appears alongside prompt, flow, agent, etc.

3. **Added comprehensive unit tests** in `swissarmyhammer-cli/tests/rule_cli_parsing_tests.rs`
   - 21 tests covering command structure, help text, argument validation
   - Tests verify all 4 subcommands exist with correct arguments
   - Tests ensure consistency with agent command pattern
   - All tests passing

### What Already Existed

The test command implementation in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/test.rs` already had:
- ✅ Real LLM execution via `LlamaAgentExecutorWrapper`
- ✅ Agent context and execution
- ✅ Response parsing (PASS vs violation)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Full unit tests

### Verification

1. **`sah rule list`** ✅ - Lists all available rules
2. **`sah rule test`** ✅ - Tests rules with sample code, shows all 6 phases
3. **All 3223 tests pass** ✅
4. **No clippy warnings** ✅
5. **Code properly formatted** ✅

## Testing

- ✅ Added 21 unit tests for `build_rule_command()` method
- ✅ Tests verify command structure and help text
- ✅ Tests ensure argument types and validation
- ✅ Tests check consistency with other command patterns
- ✅ All tests passing

## Success Criteria

- [x] CLI command registration implemented
- [x] Real LLM execution works (was already implemented)
- [x] Response parsing works (was already implemented)
- [x] Error handling robust (was already implemented)
- [x] Unit tests for CLI command structure added and passing
