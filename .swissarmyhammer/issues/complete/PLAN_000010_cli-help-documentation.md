# PLAN_000010: CLI Help Documentation

**Refer to ./specification/plan.md**

## Goal

Enhance and finalize the CLI help documentation for the plan command, ensuring it provides comprehensive guidance, clear examples, and follows the existing documentation standards in the swissarmyhammer CLI.

## Background

The plan command documentation was initially added in PLAN_000001, but needs refinement to match the high-quality documentation standards used throughout the swissarmyhammer CLI. We need to ensure the help text is comprehensive, accurate, and helpful.

## Requirements

1. Refine the long_about documentation for the Plan command
2. Ensure examples are practical and cover common use cases
3. Add usage notes and best practices
4. Include troubleshooting guidance in help text
5. Ensure consistency with other command documentation styles
6. Add information about file format requirements
7. Include performance and limitation notes where relevant

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Command Documentation

Update the Plan command in `Commands` enum:

```rust
/// Plan a specific specification file
#[command(long_about = "
Execute planning workflow for a specific specification file.
Takes a path to a markdown specification file and generates step-by-step implementation issues.

USAGE:
  swissarmyhammer plan <PLAN_FILENAME>

The planning workflow will:
• Read and analyze the specified plan file
• Review existing issues to avoid conflicts
• Generate numbered issue files in the ./issues directory  
• Create incremental, focused implementation steps
• Use existing memos and codebase context for better planning

FILE REQUIREMENTS:
The plan file should be:
• A valid markdown file (.md extension recommended)
• Readable and contain meaningful content
• Focused on a specific feature or component
• Well-structured with clear goals and requirements

OUTPUT:
Creates numbered issue files in ./issues/ directory with format:
• PLANNAME_000001_step-description.md
• PLANNAME_000002_step-description.md
• etc.

EXAMPLES:
  # Plan a new feature from specification directory
  swissarmyhammer plan ./specification/user-authentication.md
  
  # Plan using absolute path
  swissarmyhammer plan /home/user/projects/plans/database-migration.md
  
  # Plan a quick enhancement
  swissarmyhammer plan ./docs/bug-fixes.md
  
  # Plan with verbose output for debugging
  swissarmyhammer --verbose plan ./specification/api-redesign.md

TIPS:
• Keep plan files focused - break large features into multiple plans
• Review generated issues before implementation
• Use descriptive filenames that reflect the planned work
• Check existing issues directory to understand numbering
• Plan files work best when they include clear goals and acceptance criteria

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If planning fails:
• Verify file exists and is readable: ls -la <plan_file>
• Check issues directory permissions: ls -ld ./issues
• Ensure adequate disk space for issue file creation
• Try with --debug flag for detailed execution information
• Review file content for proper markdown formatting

Plan {
    /// Path to the plan file to process
    #[arg(help = "Path to the markdown plan file (relative or absolute)")]
    plan_filename: String,
},
```

### Parameter Documentation Enhancement

Enhance the parameter help text:

```rust
Plan {
    /// Path to the plan file to process
    #[arg(
        help = "Path to the markdown plan file (relative or absolute)",
        long_help = "
Path to the specification file to plan. Can be:
• Relative path: ./specification/feature.md
• Absolute path: /full/path/to/plan.md  
• Simple filename: my-plan.md (in current directory)

The file should be a readable markdown file containing
the specification or requirements to be planned."
    )]
    plan_filename: String,
},
```

## Proposed Solution

After examining the existing CLI documentation patterns and current Plan command implementation, I'll enhance the Plan command documentation to follow the comprehensive style used throughout the swissarmyhammer CLI.

### Analysis of Current Implementation

The current Plan command documentation at `/swissarmyhammer-cli/src/cli.rs:334-354` is minimal:

```rust
/// Plan a specific specification file
#[command(long_about = "
Execute planning workflow for a specific specification file.
Takes a path to a markdown specification file and generates implementation steps.

Basic usage:
  swissarmyhammer plan <plan_filename>    # Plan specific file

The planning workflow will:
- Read the specified plan file
- Generate step-by-step implementation issues
- Create numbered issue files in ./issues directory

Examples:
  swissarmyhammer plan ./specification/new-feature.md
  swissarmyhammer plan /path/to/custom-plan.md
  swissarmyhammer plan plans/database-migration.md
")]
```

### Enhancement Strategy

Following the comprehensive patterns seen in other commands (like Prompt, Flow, Issue, etc.), I'll enhance the Plan command with:

1. **Comprehensive Usage Pattern** - Clear command format with parameter explanations
2. **Detailed Workflow Description** - Step-by-step explanation of what the command does
3. **File Requirements Section** - Supported formats, structure recommendations, constraints
4. **Extensive Examples** - Covering common scenarios and different path formats
5. **Best Practices and Tips** - User guidance for optimal results
6. **Troubleshooting Section** - Common error scenarios with resolution guidance
7. **Integration Information** - How it works with other commands and flags

### Implementation Plan

1. Update the `long_about` attribute for the Plan command enum variant
2. Enhance the parameter help text with `long_help` attribute
3. Follow the established patterns from other commands for consistency
4. Include practical examples that match the actual file structure
5. Add troubleshooting guidance for common issues

The enhanced documentation will transform the Plan command help from basic information to comprehensive user guidance, matching the quality standards established throughout the swissarmyhammer CLI.
