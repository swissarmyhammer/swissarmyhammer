you did a half assed job removing memoranda to its own crate, there is still clearly a swissarmyhammer/src/memoranda folder that needs to not exist in swissarmyhammer

## Analysis

After examining the codebase, I found:

1. **Issue confirmed**: There is still a `swissarmyhammer/src/memoranda` directory with extensive code that should have been moved to the separate `swissarmyhammer-memoranda` crate.

2. **Current state**: 
   - `swissarmyhammer-memoranda` crate exists but is a simplified version with basic CRUD operations
   - `swissarmyhammer/src/memoranda` contains extensive functionality including advanced search, storage implementations, and comprehensive tests
   - The main crate still exports memoranda types and has no dependency on `swissarmyhammer-memoranda`

3. **Files in memoranda directory**:
   - `mod.rs` (58KB) - Main module with extensive documentation and type definitions
   - `storage.rs` (89KB) - Storage implementations and comprehensive tests
   - `advanced_search.rs` (33KB) - Advanced search functionality
   - `storage_markdown_tests.rs` (13KB) - Additional tests

## Proposed Solution

1. **Audit and merge functionality**: Compare the existing `swissarmyhammer-memoranda` crate with the code in `swissarmyhammer/src/memoranda` to ensure all functionality is preserved
2. **Update swissarmyhammer-memoranda crate**: Move any missing functionality from the old location to the new crate
3. **Add dependency**: Add `swissarmyhammer-memoranda` as a dependency in `swissarmyhammer/Cargo.toml`
4. **Update imports**: Replace the module declaration with re-exports from the external crate
5. **Remove old code**: Delete the `swissarmyhammer/src/memoranda` directory
6. **Update examples**: Fix any examples that reference the old module path
7. **Run tests**: Ensure all tests pass after the refactoring

## Migration Strategy Decision

After analyzing the codebase and commit history, I found:

1. **Intentional simplification**: The commit `065ae482` shows this was an intentional migration to create a simplified memoranda crate with title-based IDs instead of ULID-based IDs, and "Remove advanced search functionality as per requirements"

2. **Incomplete migration**: The old `src/memoranda` code was never removed, leaving both implementations

3. **Extensive usage**: The old memoranda module is still heavily used throughout:
   - 57 import references across 21 files
   - Particularly in swissarmyhammer-tools MCP server implementation
   - All tests still pass with the old implementation

## Decision: Complete the Migration

Since the original intention was to simplify and the new crate exists, I should complete the migration by:

1. **Replace old functionality**: Update all references to use the simplified swissarmyhammer-memoranda crate
2. **Update swissarmyhammer-tools**: Modify the MCP tools to use the new simplified API
3. **Preserve functionality**: Ensure the simplified API meets the needs of the MCP tools
4. **Remove old code**: Delete the src/memoranda directory

This approach honors the original intent while completing the migration properly.
## Progress Update

### Completed ✅
- Added swissarmyhammer-memoranda dependency to swissarmyhammer/Cargo.toml
- Updated lib.rs to use swissarmyhammer-memoranda as external crate instead of internal module
- Fixed export types to match new memoranda crate API (MemoTitle instead of MemoId, removed SearchMemosRequest/Response)
- Removed old src/memoranda directory (4 files, ~200KB of code)
- swissarmyhammer crate now compiles successfully with new memoranda dependency

### Current Issue ⚠️
swissarmyhammer-tools fails to compile due to API changes:
- 22 compilation errors related to memoranda API differences
- Key issues: MemoId → MemoTitle, method name changes (create_memo → create), Memo structure changes

### Options Going Forward
1. **Update swissarmyhammer-memoranda to maintain API compatibility** - Add MemoId support and old method names
2. **Update swissarmyhammer-tools to use new API** - Significant refactoring required
3. **Hybrid approach** - Enhance memoranda crate with compatibility layer

Recommend option 1 for less disruptive migration.
