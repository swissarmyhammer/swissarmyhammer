# Implement Core Abort MCP Tool Functionality

Refer to ./specification/abort.md

## Objective
Implement the core abort MCP tool that creates the `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file with the abort reason, providing atomic file-based abort state management.

## Context
Following the established MCP tool pattern, implement the actual abort functionality that will replace the brittle string-based "ABORT ERROR" detection. The tool must be robust, atomic, and work across process boundaries.

## Tasks

### 1. Core Tool Implementation
Implement the `abort_create` tool in `tools/abort/create/mod.rs`:
- Accept required `reason` parameter
- Create `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file with atomic operations
- Handle file creation errors gracefully
- Return success to allow proper error propagation

### 2. File-Based State Management
- Use `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file location for consistency
- Write plain text abort reason to file
- Ensure atomic file creation (create temp file, then rename)
- Handle race conditions and concurrent access

### 3. Error Handling
- Proper error handling for file system operations
- Graceful handling of directory creation if needed
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Tool should not fail - errors should be logged but tool returns success

### 4. Tool Description
Create `tools/abort/create/description.md` with:
- Clear documentation of tool purpose
- Parameter descriptions
- Usage examples
- Integration notes

## Implementation Details

### Tool Logic
```rust
pub async fn execute(&self, arguments: Value) -> Result<Value, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let params: AbortCreateParameters = serde_json::from_value(arguments)?;
    
    // Ensure .swissarmyhammer directory exists
    std::fs::create_dir_all(".swissarmyhammer")?;
    
    // Write abort file atomically
    let temp_path = ".swissarmyhammer/.abort.tmp";
    let final_path = ".swissarmyhammer/.abort";
    
    std::fs::write(temp_path, &params.reason)?;
    std::fs::rename(temp_path, final_path)?;
    
    Ok(json!({
        "success": true,
        "message": format!("Abort initiated: {}", params.reason)
    }))
}
```

### File Format
- Plain text file containing the abort reason
- No additional metadata initially (can be extended later)
- UTF-8 encoding for proper text handling

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Tool creates `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file successfully
- [ ] File contains the provided reason text
- [ ] File creation is atomic (no partial writes)
- [ ] Directory is created if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Tool handles file system errors gracefully
- [ ] Tool returns success even if file creation fails (for error propagation)
- [ ] Description.md provides clear usage instructions

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for file creation functionality
- Tests for atomic file operations
- Error handling tests for file system failures
- Concurrent access testing

## Dependencies
- ABORT_000259_mcp-tool-infrastructure (must be completed first)

## Follow-up Issues
- ABORT_000261_workflowrun-cleanup-integration

## Proposed Solution Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, I found that **the core abort tool functionality is already implemented**. The issue appears to be based on outdated information or has already been completed in previous work.

### Current State

The `abort_create` tool has already been implemented in:
- `/swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/abort/create/mod.rs` - Complete implementation
- `/swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/abort/create/description.md` - Full documentation

### Implementation Analysis

The existing implementation includes:

1. ‚úÖ **Core Tool Implementation**: `AbortCreateTool` struct with proper MCP trait implementation
2. ‚úÖ **File-Based State Management**: Creates `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file with atomic operations
3. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for file system operations with graceful degradation  
4. ‚úÖ **Tool Description**: Complete `description.md` with usage examples and integration notes
5. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests covering all functionality including file creation, directory creation, argument parsing, and error conditions

### Key Features Verified

- ‚úÖ Accepts required `reason` parameter
- ‚úÖ Creates `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file with atomic operations 
- ‚úÖ Handles file creation errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ Returns success for proper error propagation
- ‚úÖ Uses atomic file creation pattern
- ‚úÖ Handles concurrent access and race conditions
- ‚úÖ Creates directory if needed
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages and proper logging
- ‚úÖ Tool schema and MCP protocol compliance

### Next Steps

The issue requirements appear to be already satisfied. I will:

1. Run tests to validate the implementation works correctly
2. Check if the tool is properly registered in the tool registry
3. Verify integration points with the workflow system are in place
4. Mark this issue as complete if all validation passes

### Assessment

This appears to be a duplicate issue or the implementation was completed in previous work (ABORT_000259). The core abort tool functionality meets all specified requirements.
## Final Assessment

### ‚úÖ Core Abort Tool Status: COMPLETE

The core abort MCP tool functionality has been **fully implemented** and is working correctly:

**Implemented Components:**
- ‚úÖ **AbortCreateTool**: Complete implementation in `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/abort/create/mod.rs`
- ‚úÖ **Tool Registration**: Properly registered in MCP server via `register_abort_tools()`
- ‚úÖ **File Operations**: Creates `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file with atomic operations
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with proper logging and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Complete `description.md` with usage examples
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 8 passing tests covering all functionality
- ‚úÖ **Schema Validation**: JSON schema for parameter validation
- ‚úÖ **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Proper implementation of `McpTool` trait

**Test Results:**
```
test result: ok. 8 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

All required functionality from the issue specification is implemented and tested.

### üîß Integration Points: Separate Issues Required

The workflow system integration points mentioned in the specification require **separate implementation work**:

**Missing Integration (Outside Scope of Core Tool):**
- ExecutorError::Abort variant (not yet added to `ExecutorError` enum)
- Abort file detection in `execute_state_with_limit` loop (not yet implemented)  
- Abort file cleanup in `WorkflowRun::new()` (not yet implemented)

These integration points are **separate concerns** that should be implemented in follow-up issues focusing on the workflow execution system rather than the MCP tool itself.

### üìã Validation Criteria Review

‚úÖ Tool creates `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file successfully  
‚úÖ File contains the provided reason text  
‚úÖ File creation is atomic (no partial writes)  
‚úÖ Directory is created if it doesn't exist  
‚úÖ Tool handles file system errors gracefully  
‚úÖ Tool returns success even if file creation fails  
‚úÖ Description.md provides clear usage instructions  
‚úÖ Unit tests for file creation functionality  
‚úÖ Tests for atomic file operations  
‚úÖ Error handling tests for file system failures  
‚úÖ Concurrent access testing  

**All validation criteria have been met.**

### üìç Conclusion

**ABORT_000260_core-abort-tool-implementation is COMPLETE**. The core abort MCP tool functionality is fully implemented, tested, and working correctly. The workflow integration points mentioned in the specification require separate issues focused on the workflow execution system.
