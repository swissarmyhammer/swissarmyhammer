# Cross-Platform Testing and Compatibility

## Problem
While the tool is built in Rust (which supports cross-platform compilation), there's no evidence of testing across different operating systems and environments to ensure consistent behavior.

## Current State
- Development appears to be on macOS
- No CI testing on multiple platforms
- File path handling may not be Windows-compatible
- No verification of behavior differences across platforms

## Platform Support Needed
- [ ] **macOS** - Primary development platform (appears working)
- [ ] **Linux** - Various distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch)
- [ ] **Windows** - Native Windows support with proper path handling
- [ ] **WSL** - Windows Subsystem for Linux compatibility

## Cross-Platform Issues to Test

### File System Differences
- [ ] **Path Separators** - Windows `\` vs Unix `/`
- [ ] **Case Sensitivity** - Case-insensitive Windows vs case-sensitive Unix
- [ ] **File Permissions** - Unix permissions vs Windows ACLs
- [ ] **Hidden Files** - `.swissarmyhammer` directory visibility on Windows
- [ ] **Path Length Limits** - Windows 260 character limit

### Environment Differences
- [ ] **Home Directory** - `~` expansion on different platforms
- [ ] **Environment Variables** - `PATH`, `HOME`, `USERPROFILE` differences
- [ ] **Shell Integration** - bash/zsh/fish vs PowerShell/cmd
- [ ] **Terminal Capabilities** - Color support, Unicode, terminal size

### Platform-Specific Features
- [ ] **File Watching** - Different file system notification APIs
- [ ] **Process Management** - Signal handling differences
- [ ] **Network Behavior** - TCP/stdio differences across platforms
- [ ] **Binary Formats** - Executable packaging and distribution

## Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **CI Matrix** - GitHub Actions testing on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - Platform-specific test suites
- [ ] **Binary Distribution** - Cross-compiled releases for all platforms
- [ ] **Docker Testing** - Containerized testing for Linux variants

## Platform-Specific Installation
- [ ] **Windows Installer** - MSI package or installer executable
- [ ] **macOS Bundle** - .app bundle or pkg installer
- [ ] **Linux Packages** - .deb, .rpm, AppImage, Snap packages
- [ ] **Package Managers** - Platform-appropriate package managers

## Documentation and Support
- [ ] **Platform-Specific Docs** - Installation and setup for each platform
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide** - Platform-specific common issues
- [ ] **Feature Parity** - Document any platform limitations
- [ ] **Migration Guide** - Moving configurations between platforms

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Identical functionality across all supported platforms
- [ ] Automated testing prevents platform-specific regressions
- [ ] Easy installation on each platform through standard methods
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for platform differences
- [ ] Community reports successful usage across diverse environments
