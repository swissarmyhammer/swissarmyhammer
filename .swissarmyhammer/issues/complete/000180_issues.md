Any markdown file in ./issues needs to be an issue for all commands, the number nnnnnn is just a sorting convention and should never be a required part of a file name

Any markdown file in ./issues needs to be an issue for all commands, the number nnnnnn is just a sorting convention and should never be a required part of a file name

## Proposed Solution

To support any markdown file in `./issues` as a valid issue, I will modify the issue handling system to:

1. **Update `is_issue_file()` function**: Change from requiring `NNNNNN_name.md` format to accepting any `.md` file in the issues directory

2. **Modify `parse_issue_filename()` function**: Add logic to handle both:
   - Numbered files: `000123_name.md` (existing format, auto-assign number)
   - Non-numbered files: `any-name.md` (use filename as issue name, auto-assign next available number)

3. **Update issue creation logic**: When creating issues, support both naming patterns:
   - If filename has number prefix, use that number
   - If filename has no number prefix, auto-assign next available number

4. **Maintain backward compatibility**: All existing `NNNNNN_name.md` files continue to work exactly as before

5. **Keep sorting behavior**: Numbered files sort by number, non-numbered files sort alphabetically after numbered files

The key changes will be in `/swissarmyhammer/src/issues/filesystem.rs`:
- `is_issue_file()`: Accept any `.md` file
- `parse_issue_filename()`: Handle both patterns gracefully
- Issue listing/creation logic: Support mixed naming conventions

This maintains the existing numbered convention as a sorting mechanism while allowing complete flexibility in issue file naming.
