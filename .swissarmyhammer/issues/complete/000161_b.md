If a `run workflow` action fails, in a nested workflow, we need to error out and fail all the way to the root.

If a `run prompt` action fails, we need to error out and fail all the way to the root.

Create a `abort` action in order to test this.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I found that the error handling infrastructure is already quite sophisticated:

1. **Error Propagation Already Implemented**: The system has `ActionError::AbortError` that propagates through both prompt actions and nested workflows.

2. **Nested Workflow Error Handling**: The `SubWorkflowAction` already handles error propagation from nested workflows, including abort errors. It checks for "ABORT ERROR:" patterns and propagates them up.

3. **Prompt Action Error Handling**: The `PromptAction` already detects "ABORT ERROR:" patterns in responses and propagates them as `ActionError::AbortError`.

4. **Missing Component**: The only missing piece is an explicit `abort` action that can be used for testing error propagation scenarios.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create AbortAction**: Add a new action type that immediately fails with an abort error
2. **Add to Action Parser**: Update the action parser to recognize "abort" actions
3. **Write Tests**: Create comprehensive tests for error propagation scenarios
4. **Verify Error Propagation**: Ensure the existing error propagation works correctly for all scenarios

The key insight is that the error handling infrastructure is already robust - we just need to add the `abort` action to enable testing of the existing error propagation mechanisms.
