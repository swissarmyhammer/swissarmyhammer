# Comprehensive Testing for Flexible Base Branch Support

Refer to ./specification/flexible_base_branch_support.md

## Goal

Add comprehensive test coverage for flexible base branch workflows and update existing tests to work with new functionality.

## Tasks

1. **Update Existing Git Operation Tests**
   - Update tests in `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs` test module (lines 348-797)
   - Modify tests that assume main branch requirement  
   - Add source branch parameters to test calls where needed
   - Ensure backwards compatibility tests still pass

2. **Add Flexible Branching Workflow Tests**
   - Test complete workflow: feature branch → issue branch → merge back to feature branch
   - Test release branch workflows  
   - Test multiple issue branches from same source branch
   - Test complex branching scenarios

3. **Add MCP Tool Integration Tests**
   - Test issue work tool with various source branches
   - Test issue merge tool with different target branches
   - Test error conditions and abort tool integration
   - Test backwards compatibility with existing issues

4. **Add Edge Case Testing**
   - Test behavior when source branch is deleted mid-workflow
   - Test merge conflict scenarios with source branch
   - Test validation prevents circular issue branch creation
   - Test error recovery scenarios

5. **Performance and Compatibility Testing**  
   - Test performance with various Git workflow patterns
   - Test compatibility with Git Flow, GitHub Flow, etc.
   - Test with large repositories and many branches
   - Test concurrent issue branch operations

## Implementation Details

- Location: Test files in `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs`, integration test files, MCP tool tests
- Add new test cases for flexible workflows
- Update existing test cases to use source branch parameters
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all new functionality

## Testing Requirements

- All existing tests continue to pass (backwards compatibility)
- New flexible workflow tests pass
- Edge cases are tested and handled correctly
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Performance tests show acceptable performance
- Compatibility tests work with common Git workflows

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive test coverage for all flexible branching scenarios
- All existing tests pass with updated implementation
- New functionality is thoroughly tested
- Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- Performance is acceptable for common use cases
- Integration with various Git workflows is verified

This step ensures the flexible branching implementation is robust and reliable through comprehensive testing.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I've identified the comprehensive testing approach needed for flexible base branch support.

### Current Test Analysis

The existing test structure has:
- **Git Operation Tests**: `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs` lines 656-900+ with basic git operations
- **MCP Integration Tests**: Multiple test files in `swissarmyhammer/tests/` and `swissarmyhammer-cli/tests/`
- **Current Limitations**: Tests assume main branch workflows and don't cover flexible branching scenarios

### Testing Implementation Plan

#### 1. Update Existing Git Operation Tests (`swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs`)

**Tests requiring updates:**
- `test_create_work_branch()` - Update to test source branch tracking
- `test_merge_issue_branch()` - Test merge back to various source branches
- `test_current_branch()` - Ensure compatibility with feature branches
- `test_main_branch()` - Modify to test source branch detection
- Add new parameter testing for `create_work_branch_with_source()`

#### 2. Add New Flexible Branching Workflow Tests

**Complete workflow tests:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_feature_to_issue_to_merge_workflow() {
    // Create feature branch
    // Create issue branch from feature branch  
    // Merge issue back to feature branch
    // Verify all changes in feature branch
}

#[test]
fn test_release_branch_issue_workflow() {
    // Test release branch as source for issues
}

#[test]
fn test_multiple_issues_from_same_source() {
    // Test multiple issue branches from same feature branch
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced MCP Tool Integration Tests

**New test files:**
- `flexible_branching_mcp_tests.rs` - Comprehensive MCP tool testing
- Test `issue_work` tool with various source branches
- Test `issue_merge` tool with different target branches  
- Test backwards compatibility with existing issues

#### 4. Edge Case and Error Handling Tests

**Critical edge cases:**
- Source branch deleted mid-workflow (should trigger abort)
- Merge conflict scenarios with source branch changes
- Circular issue branch prevention validation
- Invalid source branch scenarios

#### 5. Performance and Integration Tests

**Performance validation:**
- Large repository testing with multiple branches
- Concurrent issue branch operations
- Git workflow pattern compatibility (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)

### Test Implementation Strategy

1. **Test-Driven Approach**: Write failing tests first, then ensure implementation passes
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing tests must continue passing
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cover all new flexible branching functionality
4. **Real Repository Testing**: Use actual git operations, not mocks
5. **Error Scenario Testing**: Validate proper error handling and abort integration

### Expected Test Structure

```
swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs - Enhanced unit tests
swissarmyhammer/tests/flexible_branching_integration.rs - New integration tests  
swissarmyhammer-cli/tests/flexible_branching_mcp_e2e.rs - End-to-end MCP testing
swissarmyhammer/tests/flexible_branching_edge_cases.rs - Edge case validation
```

### Success Criteria

- All existing tests pass (backwards compatibility)
- New flexible workflow tests pass
- Edge cases properly handled with abort integration
- Performance acceptable for common use cases
- Full MCP tool integration validated
- Git Flow/GitHub Flow compatibility confirmed

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the flexible branching implementation is robust, reliable, and maintains backwards compatibility while enabling new flexible workflows.
