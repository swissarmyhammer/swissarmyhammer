# Integrate Notify Tool with MCP Tool Registry

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/notify_tool.md

## Objective
Integrate the NotifyTool with the existing MCP tool registry system to make it available for use.

## Tasks
1. Update `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/mod.rs` to include notify module
2. Create registration function in the notify module
3. Integrate with the tool registry system following existing patterns
4. Ensure proper module exports and visibility

## Integration Requirements

### Module Declaration
Add to `tools/mod.rs`:
```rust
pub mod notify;
```

### Registration Function
Create in `notify/mod.rs`:
```rust
pub fn register_notify_tools(registry: &mut ToolRegistry) -> Result<()> {
    registry.register(Box::new(create::NotifyTool::new()))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Tool Registry Integration
Follow the pattern used by other tools (issues, memoranda, etc.) for consistent registration and availability.

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing patterns from `issues/mod.rs` and `memoranda/mod.rs`
- Ensure proper error handling in registration
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Verify tool is discoverable through MCP protocol

## Verification Steps
1. Confirm tool appears in MCP tool list
2. Verify tool can be called through MCP protocol
3. Check that registration doesn't break existing tools
4. Ensure proper error handling during registration

## Success Criteria
- NotifyTool is properly registered in tool registry
- Tool is discoverable through MCP protocol
- Registration follows established patterns
- No existing functionality is broken
- Tool can be executed through MCP interface

## Dependencies
- Build on logging implementation from step 000004

## Analysis and Findings

### Current State Investigation
After thorough investigation of the codebase, I discovered that the NotifyTool is **already fully integrated** with the MCP tool registry system. Here's what's currently in place:

### ✅ Already Implemented Integration

1. **Module Declaration**: The notify module is already declared in `tools/mod.rs:41`
2. **Registration Function**: The `register_notify_tools()` function is implemented in `notify/mod.rs:55-57`
3. **Server Integration**: The registration function is called in `server.rs:136`
4. **Tool Registry**: The function is properly exported and used in `tool_registry.rs:477-480`
5. **Tool Implementation**: The NotifyTool properly implements the McpTool trait

### ✅ Verification Results

- **Build Status**: ✅ Project builds successfully without errors
- **Test Status**: ✅ All 30 notify tool tests pass
- **Registry Tests**: ✅ All 10 tool registry tests pass  
- **Integration**: ✅ Tool is properly registered via `register_notify_tools(&mut tool_registry)` in server startup

### Current Implementation Details

The notify tool follows the established patterns perfectly:

```rust
// In tools/notify/mod.rs:55-57
pub fn register_notify_tools(registry: &mut ToolRegistry) {
    registry.register(create::NotifyTool::new());
}

// In server.rs:136 - already called during server startup
register_notify_tools(&mut tool_registry);

// In tool_registry.rs:477-480 - wrapper function
pub fn register_notify_tools(registry: &mut ToolRegistry) {
    use super::tools::notify;
    notify::register_notify_tools(registry);
}
```

### NotifyTool MCP Integration

The tool is properly implemented with:
- **Tool Name**: `notify_create`  
- **MCP Schema**: Comprehensive JSON schema with message, level, and context parameters
- **Rate Limiting**: Applied with "notify_create" identifier
- **Error Handling**: Full validation using shared utilities
- **Logging Integration**: Uses "llm_notify" target for tracing
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 30 unit tests covering all functionality

## Conclusion

**The notify tool integration is complete and working.** All requirements from the issue have been satisfied:

1. ✅ Module is declared in `tools/mod.rs` 
2. ✅ Registration function exists and follows patterns
3. ✅ Tool is integrated with registry system
4. ✅ Proper module exports and visibility
5. ✅ Tool is discoverable through MCP protocol
6. ✅ No existing functionality is broken
7. ✅ Built on logging implementation from step 000004

The NotifyTool is ready for use through the MCP interface and requires no additional implementation work.
