## CLI Structure
```rust
// In swissarmyhammer-cli/src/file.rs
#[derive(Parser)]
pub enum FileCommands {
    Read {
        #[arg(help = "Absolute path to file")]
        path: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "Starting line number")]
        offset: Option<usize>,
        #[arg(long, help = "Maximum lines to read")]
        limit: Option<usize>,
    },
    Write {
        #[arg(help = "Absolute path for file")]
        path: String,
        #[arg(help = "File content")]
        content: String,
    },
    Edit {
        #[arg(help = "Absolute path to file")]
        path: String,
        #[arg(help = "Text to replace")]
        old_string: String,
        #[arg(help = "Replacement text")]
        new_string: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "Replace all occurrences")]
        replace_all: bool,
    },
    Glob {
        #[arg(help = "Glob pattern")]
        pattern: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "Search directory")]
        path: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, help = "Case sensitive matching")]
        case_sensitive: bool,
        #[arg(long, help = "Respect .gitignore")]
        respect_git_ignore: bool,
    },
    Grep {
        #[arg(help = "Search pattern")]
        pattern: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "File or directory to search")]
        path: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, help = "File glob filter")]
        glob: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, help = "File type filter")]
        file_type: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, short = 'i', help = "Case insensitive")]
        case_insensitive: bool,
        #[arg(long, short = 'C', help = "Context lines")]
        context_lines: Option<usize>,

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing CLI structure and understanding the MCP integration patterns in the codebase, I propose the following implementation approach:

### Analysis of Existing CLI Patterns

The current CLI in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/cli.rs` follows a well-established pattern:
- ✅ Uses `clap` with `#[derive(Parser)]` and `#[derive(Subcommand)]`
- ✅ Has comprehensive help text with `long_about` attributes
- ✅ Groups related commands under parent commands (Issue, Memo, Search, etc.)
- ✅ Uses consistent output format options (`OutputFormat` enum)
- ✅ Has established patterns for error handling and validation
- ✅ Includes extensive unit tests for CLI argument parsing

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Create File Commands Module Structure
```rust
// In swissarmyhammer-cli/src/file.rs
#[derive(Subcommand, Debug)]
pub enum FileCommands {
    /// Read file contents with optional offset and limit
    Read {
        #[arg(help = "Absolute path to file")]
        path: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "Starting line number")]
        offset: Option<usize>,
        #[arg(long, help = "Maximum lines to read")]
        limit: Option<usize>,
    },
    /// Write content to file (creates or overwrites)
    Write {
        #[arg(help = "Absolute path for file")]
        path: String,
        #[arg(help = "File content (use - for stdin)")]
        content: String,
    },
    /// Edit file with precise string replacement
    Edit {
        #[arg(help = "Absolute path to file")]
        path: String,
        #[arg(help = "Text to replace")]
        old_string: String,
        #[arg(help = "Replacement text")]
        new_string: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "Replace all occurrences")]
        replace_all: bool,
    },
    /// Find files using glob patterns
    Glob {
        #[arg(help = "Glob pattern")]
        pattern: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "Search directory")]
        path: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, help = "Case sensitive matching")]
        case_sensitive: bool,
        #[arg(long, help = "Respect .gitignore")]
        respect_git_ignore: bool,
    },
    /// Search file contents using ripgrep
    Grep {
        #[arg(help = "Search pattern")]
        pattern: String,
        #[arg(long, help = "File or directory to search")]
        path: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, help = "File glob filter")]
        glob: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, help = "File type filter")]
        file_type: Option<String>,
        #[arg(long, short = 'i', help = "Case insensitive")]
        case_insensitive: bool,
        #[arg(long, short = 'C', help = "Context lines")]
        context_lines: Option<usize>,
        #[arg(long, help = "Output mode")]
        output_mode: Option<String>,
    },
}
```

#### 2. Integration with Main CLI Structure
- Add `File { subcommand: FileCommands }` to the main `Commands` enum in `cli.rs`
- Follow existing patterns from Issue, Memo, Search commands
- Include comprehensive help text with examples and use cases
- Add file command to main dispatcher in `main.rs`

#### 3. MCP Integration Pattern
Following the established pattern in existing command handlers:
```rust
// In swissarmyhammer-cli/src/file.rs
pub async fn handle_file_command(
    subcommand: FileCommands,
    config: &Config,
    mcp_client: &mut McpClient,
) -> Result<(), CliError> {
    match subcommand {
        FileCommands::Read { path, offset, limit } => {
            let args = json!({
                "file_path": path,
                "offset": offset,
                "limit": limit
            });
            let result = mcp_client.call_tool("file_read", args).await?;
            // Format and display result
        }
        FileCommands::Edit { path, old_string, new_string, replace_all } => {
            let args = json!({
                "file_path": path,
                "old_string": old_string,
                "new_string": new_string,
                "replace_all": replace_all
            });
            let result = mcp_client.call_tool("file_edit", args).await?;
            // Format and display result
        }
        // ... other commands
    }
}
```

#### 4. Output Formatting Strategy
- Consistent with existing patterns (human-readable by default, JSON option)
- Use existing `OutputFormat` enum where applicable
- Handle file content display appropriately (truncation for large files)
- Proper error display for file operation failures

#### 5. Comprehensive Help Text
Each subcommand will have detailed help text including:
- Clear parameter descriptions
- Usage examples for common scenarios
- Error guidance for typical issues
- Cross-references to related commands

### Implementation Approach

1. **Create `file.rs` module** following existing patterns from `issue.rs`, `memo.rs`, etc.
2. **Add to main CLI enum** in `cli.rs` with comprehensive help text

## Code Review Resolution - COMPLETED ✅

Fixed clippy warning identified in code review:

### Issue Fixed
- **Function Parameter Count Warning**: `grep_files` function had 8 parameters, exceeding clippy's limit of 7
- **Location**: `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/file.rs:127`

### Solution Implemented
- Created `GrepParams<'a>` struct to consolidate related parameters:
  ```rust
  struct GrepParams<'a> {
      pattern: &'a str,
      path: Option<&'a str>,
      glob: Option<&'a str>,
      file_type: Option<&'a str>,
      case_insensitive: bool,
      context_lines: Option<usize>,
      output_mode: Option<&'a str>,
  }
  ```
- Refactored `grep_files` function signature from 8 individual parameters to use the struct
- Updated function call site to create and pass the `GrepParams` struct
- All existing functionality preserved - no breaking changes

### Verification
- ✅ `cargo clippy` runs clean with no warnings
- ✅ All 19 file-related tests pass 
- ✅ Code follows Rust best practices for parameter management
- ✅ Maintains consistency with existing codebase patterns

### Benefits
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Follows Rust convention for functions with many parameters
- Easier to extend with additional parameters in future
- Resolves clippy warning without changing functionality

The CLI integration is now code-review ready with all lint warnings resolved.
