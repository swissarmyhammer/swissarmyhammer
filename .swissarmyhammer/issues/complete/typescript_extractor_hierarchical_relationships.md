# TypeScript Extractor TODO - Build Hierarchical Relationships

## Issue Location
File: `swissarmyhammer/src/outline/extractors/typescript.rs:1283`

## Description
There's a TODO comment in the TypeScript extractor about building proper hierarchical relationships for classes, interfaces, namespaces, etc.

## Current State
The `build_hierarchy` method currently returns symbols as-is without building relationships between:
- Classes and their methods/properties
- Interfaces and their members
- Namespaces and their contents
- Module hierarchies
- Nested types and their containers

## Expected Behavior
The TypeScript extractor should build proper hierarchical relationships to show the nested structure of TypeScript code, making the outline more useful for navigation and understanding code structure.

## Implementation Notes
This aligns with the hierarchical relationship work being done in other extractors (JavaScript, Python, Dart, Rust).

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the Rust extractor implementation that was recently completed, I will implement hierarchical relationships for TypeScript using the same proven pattern:

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Multi-pass hierarchical building**: Process symbols in priority order to build proper parent-child relationships
   - First pass: Process classes and their methods/properties/constructors
   - Second pass: Process interfaces and their members  
   - Third pass: Process namespaces/modules and their contents
   - Fourth pass: Process enums (already properly structured)
   - Fifth pass: Add remaining top-level symbols

2. **Range-based containment**: Use `is_symbol_within_range()` helper method to determine if a symbol belongs within another symbol's scope based on:
   - Byte range containment (`source_range`)
   - Line number containment (`start_line` to `end_line`)

3. **Hierarchical relationships to implement**:
   - **Classes**: Methods, properties, constructors, getters/setters as children
   - **Interfaces**: Method signatures, properties as children
   - **Namespaces/Modules**: All contained symbols (classes, functions, variables, types) as children
   - **Type nesting**: Nested type aliases within modules/namespaces

### Benefits
- Improved code navigation with proper nesting structure
- Better understanding of TypeScript code organization
- Consistency with other extractors (Rust, Python, etc.)
- More useful outline display for IDEs and documentation tools
## Implementation Complete ✅

Successfully implemented hierarchical relationships for the TypeScript extractor following the proven pattern from the Rust extractor.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Replaced TODO implementation** in `build_hierarchy()` method with comprehensive hierarchical processing
2. **Added helper method** `is_symbol_within_range()` to determine parent-child relationships based on byte ranges and line numbers
3. **Multi-pass processing strategy**:
   - **First pass**: Process namespaces/modules (largest containers)
   - **Second pass**: Process classes and their methods/properties  
   - **Third pass**: Process interfaces and their members
   - **Fourth pass**: Process enums
   - **Fifth pass**: Add remaining top-level symbols

4. **Intelligent member filtering**: Namespaces only take top-level constructs (classes, interfaces, functions) and don't steal members that belong to classes/interfaces

### Testing Results

- ✅ All existing TypeScript extractor tests pass (15/15)
- ✅ New comprehensive hierarchical relationships test passes
- ✅ Proper namespace structure: `MyLibrary` namespace contains 3 children (interface, class, function)
- ✅ No regressions in other extractors (Python, Dart, Rust tests still pass)

### Benefits Achieved

- **Improved code navigation**: Proper nesting structure for TypeScript code
- **Better IDE integration**: Outline views now show hierarchical relationships
- **Consistency**: Matches hierarchical patterns from other extractors
- **Enhanced documentation**: More useful outline display for TypeScript projects

### Files Modified

- `swissarmyhammer/src/outline/extractors/typescript.rs:1282-1414` - Implemented hierarchical relationship building
- Added comprehensive test with real TypeScript namespace, class, interface, and function hierarchy

The TypeScript extractor now provides proper hierarchical relationships for classes, interfaces, namespaces, and their members, significantly improving code outline functionality.

## Status: **COMPLETED** ✅
