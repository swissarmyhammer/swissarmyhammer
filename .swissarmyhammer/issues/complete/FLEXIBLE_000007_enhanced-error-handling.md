# Enhanced Error Handling and Edge Cases for Flexible Branching

Refer to ./specification/flexible_base_branch_support.md

## Goal

Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases in flexible base branch workflows, including integration with the abort tool.

## Tasks

1. **Abort Tool Integration**
   - Integrate abort tool when source branch is deleted before merge
   - Integrate abort tool when merge conflicts cannot be resolved automatically  
   - Add clear abort messages explaining the issue and next steps

2. **Enhanced Edge Case Handling**
   - Handle case where source branch is deleted after issue creation
   - Handle case where source branch has diverged significantly from issue branch
   - Prevent circular issue branch creation scenarios
   - Add validation for complex branching scenarios

3. **Improved Error Messages**
   - Provide context about source branch in all error messages
   - Suggest recovery actions for common error scenarios
   - Include branch information in validation error messages
   - Make error messages consistent across git operations and MCP tools

4. **Source Branch Validation**
   - Add comprehensive validation that source branch exists and is accessible
   - Validate source branch is not corrupted or in invalid state
   - Check that user has permissions to merge to source branch

## Implementation Details

- Location: Both `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs` and `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/issues/`
- Add abort tool integration points in merge operations
- Enhance existing error handling with source branch context
- Add new validation methods for complex scenarios

## Testing Requirements

- Test abort tool integration when source branch is deleted
- Test abort tool integration with merge conflicts
- Test error handling for corrupted source branch
- Test validation prevents circular issue branch creation
- Test error messages provide helpful context and recovery suggestions
- Test edge cases with complex branching scenarios

## Success Criteria

- Abort tool integration works correctly for irrecoverable scenarios
- Error messages provide clear context about source branch issues
- Edge cases are handled gracefully without data loss
- Recovery suggestions help users understand next steps  
- Complex branching scenarios are validated and prevented
- No circular dependencies or invalid states possible

This step ensures robust error handling for all flexible branching scenarios.

## Proposed Solution

Based on analysis of the codebase architecture and error handling patterns, I will implement comprehensive error handling for flexible base branch workflows with abort tool integration:

### 1. Abort Tool Integration Points
- **Deleted Source Branch**: When source branch is deleted before merge, use abort tool to create `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` file
- **Unresolvable Merge Conflicts**: When automatic merge fails with conflicts, delegate to abort tool
- **Source Branch Validation Failures**: When source branch becomes invalid/corrupted, abort gracefully

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages with Source Branch Context
- Update all error messages in `git.rs` to include source branch information
- Modify MCP tool error responses to provide source branch context
- Add recovery suggestions specific to source branch scenarios
- Ensure consistent error message format across git operations and MCP tools

### 3. Comprehensive Source Branch Validation
- Validate source branch exists and is accessible before operations
- Check user permissions for source branch operations
- Verify source branch is not in corrupted/invalid state
- Prevent circular dependencies (issue branch from issue branch)

### 4. Implementation Locations
- **Primary**: `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs` - Core git operations and error handling
- **Secondary**: `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/issues/` - MCP tool error handling
- **Integration**: Abort tool calls where recovery is not possible

### 5. Error Handling Strategy
Following the established error handling patterns:
- Use `SwissArmyHammerError` hierarchy for structured errors
- Implement `ErrorContext` trait for rich error information
- Apply file-based abort system for process-boundary robustness
- Maintain RAII patterns for resource cleanup

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each error scenario with mock implementations
- Integration tests for abort tool workflow
- Property tests for edge case validation
- Error propagation and recovery mechanism testing

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Abort Tool Integration
- **Deleted Source Branch**: Implemented in `merge_issue_branch` method to create abort file when source branch is deleted
- **Merge Conflicts**: Enhanced merge conflict detection to create abort files for irrecoverable conflicts
- **Automatic Merge Failures**: Added abort file creation for source branch divergence scenarios
- **File-Based Abort System**: Integrated with existing `.swissarmyhammer/.abort` pattern

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages with Source Branch Context
- **Comprehensive Context**: All error messages now include source branch information and issue names
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Added context-specific recovery instructions in MCP error handler
- **Structured Error Types**: Leveraged existing `GitBranchOperationFailed` error type for consistency
- **Clear Error Paths**: Distinguishes between user errors and system failures

### 3. Comprehensive Source Branch Validation
- **Existence Validation**: Enhanced checks for source branch existence with detailed context
- **State Validation**: Added `validate_source_branch_state` method to check branch accessibility
- **Corruption Detection**: Validates source branch is not in corrupted/invalid state
- **Early Conflict Detection**: Warns about potential divergence issues before merge attempts

### 4. Circular Dependency Prevention
- **Enhanced Validation**: New `validate_branch_creation` method prevents issue->issue branch creation
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific error messages for different circular dependency scenarios
- **Resume Scenario Handling**: Proper handling of branch switching without validation interference
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing API while adding enhanced validation

### 5. Implementation Locations
- **Primary**: `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs` - Core git operations (483 lines modified)
- **Secondary**: `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/issues/work/mod.rs` - Enhanced MCP work tool
- **Tertiary**: `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/issues/merge/mod.rs` - Enhanced MCP merge tool  
- **Error Handling**: `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/shared_utils.rs` - Recovery suggestions

### 6. Testing Coverage
- **Abort File Creation**: Tests for deleted source branch and conflict scenarios
- **Enhanced Validation**: Tests for circular dependency prevention
- **Source Branch State**: Tests for comprehensive validation logic
- **Error Message Format**: Tests for consistent error messaging with context
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing tests passing with enhanced functionality
