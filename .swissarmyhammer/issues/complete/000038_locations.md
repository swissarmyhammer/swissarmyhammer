Local prompts needs to be in `./swissarmyhammer/prompts` not in ./prompts.

Need to walk 'up' to root looking for `.swissarmyhammer` directories and accumulate prompts.

-promtps/builtin: least specific

-then ~/.swissarmyhammer/prompts

then ./.swissarmyhammer -- recursively looking up, with the current directory as most specific
