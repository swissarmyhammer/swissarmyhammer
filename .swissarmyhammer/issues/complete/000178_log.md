Default log to ./.swissarmyhammer/mcp.log. Allow overridin with an env var. This is instead of logging to your home directory

## Proposed Solution

Change the MCP logging behavior in `main.rs:56-60` to use the current working directory instead of the home directory:

1. **Current Implementation**: Logs to `~/.swissarmyhammer/mcp.log` (home directory)
2. **Required Implementation**: Logs to `./.swissarmyhammer/mcp.log` (current working directory)

The change will modify the log directory path from:
```rust
let log_dir = if let Some(home) = dirs::home_dir() {
    home.join(".swissarmyhammer")
} else {
    PathBuf::from(".swissarmyhammer")
};
```

To:
```rust
let log_dir = PathBuf::from(".swissarmyhammer");
```

This simplifies the logic since we always use the current directory, and maintains the existing `SWISSARMYHAMMER_LOG_FILE` environment variable support for filename override.

### Steps:
1. Write tests to verify the new logging path behavior
2. Update the logging path logic in main.rs
3. Verify the change works as expected
