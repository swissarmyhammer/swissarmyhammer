# File Tools Security and Validation Framework

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-filetools/ideas/tools.md

## Objective
Implement comprehensive security validation for file system operations to ensure safe access within workspace boundaries.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement `FilePathValidator` with workspace boundary validation
- [ ] Create path normalization utilities to handle relative paths and symlinks
- [ ] Implement file type detection and validation
- [ ] Add permission checking utilities
- [ ] Create secure file access wrappers
- [ ] Implement protection against path traversal attacks
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for security violations

## Security Requirements
- All file paths must be absolute and within workspace boundaries
- Path normalization to resolve symlinks and relative references
- Validation against attempting to access system files outside workspace
- Permission verification before file operations
- Protection against malicious path patterns (../, etc.)

## Implementation Components
```rust
// In files/shared_utils.rs
pub struct FilePathValidator;
pub struct SecureFileAccess;
pub enum FileAccessError;

// Key functions
- validate_absolute_path(path: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf>
- ensure_workspace_boundary(path: &Path) -> Result<()>
- check_file_permissions(path: &Path, operation: FileOperation) -> Result<()>
- normalize_and_validate_path(path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf>
```

## Test Coverage
- [ ] Path traversal attack prevention
- [ ] Workspace boundary enforcement  
- [ ] Permission validation
- [ ] Malformed path handling
- [ ] Symlink resolution security

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All security validation functions implemented and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for security scenarios
- [ ] Integration with existing error handling patterns
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in path handling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for validation overhead
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I see that basic security validation is already implemented in `files/shared_utils.rs`. However, the issue requests a more comprehensive security framework. Here's my proposed implementation approach:

### Current State Analysis
- Basic path validation exists with `validate_file_path()`  
- File existence checking with `file_exists()`
- Basic error handling for filesystem operations
- Absolute path requirements are enforced

### Enhancements Needed

#### 1. Enhanced FilePathValidator Structure
```rust
pub struct FilePathValidator {
    workspace_root: Option<PathBuf>,
    allow_symlinks: bool,
    blocked_patterns: Vec<String>,
}

impl FilePathValidator {
    pub fn new() -> Self
    pub fn with_workspace_root(path: PathBuf) -> Self
    pub fn validate_absolute_path(&self, path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf>
    pub fn ensure_workspace_boundary(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<()>
}
```

#### 2. Advanced Path Normalization
- Implement secure symlink resolution that respects workspace boundaries
- Add detection of malicious path patterns (../, \\..\\, etc.)
- Normalize mixed path separators and Unicode normalization
- Validate against known dangerous system paths

#### 3. Enhanced File Type Detection  
```rust
pub enum FileAccessType {
    Read,
    Write, 
    Execute,
}

pub fn validate_file_type_access(path: &Path, access_type: FileAccessType) -> Result<()>
```

#### 4. Permission Checking Utilities
```rust
pub fn check_file_permissions(path: &Path, operation: FileOperation) -> Result<()>
```

#### 5. SecureFileAccess Wrapper
```rust  
pub struct SecureFileAccess {
    validator: FilePathValidator,
}

impl SecureFileAccess {
    pub fn read(&self, path: &str, offset: Option<usize>, limit: Option<usize>) -> Result<String>
    pub fn write(&self, path: &str, content: &str) -> Result<()>
    pub fn edit(&self, path: &str, old: &str, new: &str, replace_all: bool) -> Result<()>
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Extend existing shared_utils.rs** with enhanced validation functions while maintaining backward compatibility
2. **Add comprehensive path traversal protection** with pattern detection and workspace boundary enforcement
3. **Implement file type and permission validation** for each operation type
4. **Create secure wrapper layer** that individual tools can use
5. **Add extensive unit and integration tests** for security scenarios

### Test Coverage Plan
- Path traversal attack prevention (../../../etc/passwd style attacks)
- Workspace boundary enforcement with edge cases
- Symlink resolution security testing
- Unicode and encoding attack prevention
- Permission validation across different file types
- Malformed path handling (null bytes, invalid characters)

This approach enhances security while maintaining compatibility with existing file tool implementations.

### 🔒 Security Features Summary

1. **Workspace Boundary Enforcement**: All file operations restricted to configured workspace
2. **Path Traversal Protection**: Blocks `../`, `./`, `\\..\` and other dangerous patterns
3. **Symlink Resolution Security**: Configurable symlink handling with boundary re-validation

- **Simplified Tools**: File tools now have cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Centralized Security**: All validation logic consolidated in shared utilities

### 📝 Usage Example

```rust
// Enhanced security with workspace boundaries
let validator = FilePathValidator::with_workspace_root("/safe/workspace".into());
let secure_access = SecureFileAccess::new(validator);

// All operations are automatically secured
let content = secure_access.read("/safe/workspace/file.txt", None, None)?;
secure_access.write("/safe/workspace/output.txt", "safe content")?;
secure_access.edit("/safe/workspace/config.txt", "old_value", "new_value", false)?;
```

**This implementation successfully addresses all security requirements while maintaining backward compatibility and improving code maintainability.**
