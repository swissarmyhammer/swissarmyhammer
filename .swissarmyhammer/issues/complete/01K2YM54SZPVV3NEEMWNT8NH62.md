when we use git ops to delete a branch, check first if it exists -- if the branch does not exist -- no error, already deleted and we got the outcome we were seeking. Add an integration test case for this

## Proposed Solution

The issue is in the `delete_branch` method in `git.rs` at line 523. Currently, when git branch deletion fails for any reason (including when the branch doesn't exist), it creates an abort file and returns an error. This is problematic because if a branch is already deleted, we've achieved our desired outcome.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Modify `delete_branch` method**: Check if the branch exists before attempting to delete it
2. **Add early return for non-existent branches**: If the branch doesn't exist, return `Ok(())` since the desired outcome (branch deleted) is already achieved
3. **Keep existing error handling**: For other failure cases (permission issues, git failures, etc.)
4. **Add integration test**: Test the scenario where we try to delete a non-existent branch

### Code Changes:
- Update `GitOperations::delete_branch()` to check `branch_exists()` first
- If branch doesn't exist, log info and return success
- If branch exists, proceed with deletion as normal
- Keep all existing error handling for actual failures

This follows the principle that operations should be idempotent - calling delete on a non-existent branch should succeed since the desired state (branch not existing) is already achieved.
## Implementation Completed

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `GitOperations::delete_branch()` method** (git.rs:523-553):
   - Added early check using `branch_exists()` method
   - If branch doesn't exist, log info message and return `Ok(())` 
   - Fixed git command argument construction to avoid passing empty strings
   - Maintained existing error handling for actual git failures

2. **Added comprehensive integration tests**:
   - `test_delete_branch_nonexistent_succeeds`: Tests deleting a non-existent branch succeeds
   - `test_delete_branch_existing_succeeds`: Tests deleting an existing branch works as before
   - `test_delete_branch_nonexistent_then_existing`: Tests idempotent behavior

### Technical Details:
- The fix makes branch deletion idempotent - calling it multiple times has the same effect
- No behavior change for existing branches - they are deleted as before
- Fixed a bug in git command construction where `force: false` was passing empty string as argument
- All 43 existing git tests continue to pass - no regressions

### Test Results:
```
running 3 tests
test git::tests::test_delete_branch_nonexistent_succeeds ... ok
test git::tests::test_delete_branch_nonexistent_then_existing ... ok  
test git::tests::test_delete_branch_existing_succeeds ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

The implementation successfully addresses the original issue: when git ops is used to delete a branch, it first checks if the branch exists. If not, no error is thrown since the desired outcome (branch not existing) has already been achieved.
