# Fix File Operation Tools to Return Simple Responses

## Problem
The file operation tools (edit, write, read) are disobeying instructions by returning overly verbose, technical responses instead of simple confirmations. These tools provide unnecessary technical details when simple "OK" responses were requested.

## Current Behavior (Wrong)

### files/edit/mod.rs - Lines 450-452:
```rust
"Successfully edited file: {} | {} replacements made | {} bytes written | Encoding: {} | Line endings: {} | Metadata preserved: {}"
```

### files/write/mod.rs - Line 194:
```rust
"Successfully wrote {} bytes to {}"
```

### files/read/mod.rs - Line 213:
```rust
"Successfully read file content"
```

## Required Behavior (Correct)

### File Edit Tool:
Should return simple: `{"message": "OK"}`

### File Write Tool: 
Should return simple: `{"message": "OK"}`

### File Read Tool:
Should just return the file content without success announcements

## Evidence of Disobedience
- Tools were instructed to provide simple responses
- Currently returning technical implementation details (bytes written, encoding, line endings, replacements made)
- Over-engineering responses with unnecessary metadata
- Violating the principle: "do what was asked, nothing more, nothing less"

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix File Edit Tool
- [ ] Update `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/edit/mod.rs`
- [ ] Change verbose response on line ~450 to simple `"OK"`
- [ ] Remove technical details: replacements made, bytes written, encoding, line endings, metadata preservation
- [ ] Update tests to expect simple "OK" response
- [ ] Verify file editing functionality still works

### Phase 2: Fix File Write Tool
- [ ] Update `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/write/mod.rs`
- [ ] Change response on line ~194 from detailed bytes/file info to simple `"OK"`
- [ ] Remove technical details about file size and path
- [ ] Update tests to expect simple "OK" response  
- [ ] Verify file writing functionality still works

### Phase 3: Fix File Read Tool
- [ ] Update `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/read/mod.rs`
- [ ] Remove success announcement on line ~213
- [ ] Return only the file content without "Successfully read file content" message
- [ ] Update tests if they expect success messages
- [ ] Verify file reading functionality still works

### Phase 4: Update Tests
- [ ] Update test assertions in `files/edit/mod.rs` around line 907-909
- [ ] Update test assertions in `files/write/mod.rs` around line 584  
- [ ] Remove expectations for verbose technical details
- [ ] Tests should verify functionality works, not response verbosity

### Phase 5: Update Documentation
- [ ] Update tool descriptions in `files/edit/description.md`
- [ ] Update tool descriptions in `files/write/description.md`
- [ ] Update tool descriptions in `files/read/description.md`
- [ ] Remove examples showing verbose responses
- [ ] Show simple "OK" responses in examples

## Files to Update

### Core Implementation Files
- `src/mcp/tools/files/edit/mod.rs` - Simplify edit response
- `src/mcp/tools/files/write/mod.rs` - Simplify write response  
- `src/mcp/tools/files/read/mod.rs` - Remove success announcement

### Test Files
- Update test assertions that expect verbose responses
- Verify functionality still works with simple responses

### Documentation Files  
- `src/mcp/tools/files/edit/description.md` - Update examples
- `src/mcp/tools/files/write/description.md` - Update examples
- `src/mcp/tools/files/read/description.md` - Update examples

## Success Criteria
- [ ] File edit tool returns simple `{"message": "OK"}`
- [ ] File write tool returns simple `{"message": "OK"}`
- [ ] File read tool returns only content without success messages
- [ ] No technical implementation details in responses
- [ ] File operations continue to work correctly
- [ ] Tests pass with simple response expectations
- [ ] Documentation reflects simple response format

## Risk Mitigation
- Ensure file operations still work correctly after response changes
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify error messages are still informative
- Keep actual functionality intact while simplifying responses

## Notes
This addresses the core disobedience of providing complex technical details when simple confirmations were requested. The principle is: **do the work correctly, but respond simply**.

File operations should work exactly the same - only the response format changes from verbose technical details to simple "OK" confirmations.

## Proposed Solution

After examining the code, I found the exact locations where verbose responses are generated:

### File Edit Tool (`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/edit/mod.rs` ~line 450)
**Current Code:**
```rust
let success_message = format!(
    "Successfully edited file: {} | {} replacements made | {} bytes written | Encoding: {} | Line endings: {} | Metadata preserved: {}",
    request.file_path,
    edit_result.replacements_made,
    edit_result.bytes_written,
    edit_result.encoding_detected,
    edit_result.line_endings_preserved,
    edit_result.metadata_preserved
);
```

**Fix:** Replace with simple `"OK"` message

### File Write Tool (`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/write/mod.rs` ~line 193)
**Current Code:**
```rust
let success_message = format!(
    "Successfully wrote {} bytes to {}",
    bytes_written, request.file_path
);
```

**Fix:** Replace with simple `"OK"` message

### File Read Tool (`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/read/mod.rs` ~line 213)
**Current Code:**
```rust
debug!(
    path = %request.absolute_path,
    content_length = content.len(),
    "Successfully read file content"  // This debug message is fine
);
```

**Analysis:** The read tool actually returns just the content via `BaseToolImpl::create_success_response(content)` - no verbose success message in the response itself.

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Edit Tool:** Change verbose format string to simple `"OK"`
2. **Write Tool:** Change verbose format string to simple `"OK"`  
3. **Read Tool:** Already correct - only returns content
4. **Preserve Functionality:** All file operations will work exactly the same, only response messages change
5. **Update Tests:** Fix any tests expecting verbose responses

### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk:** Only changing response messages, not core functionality
- **Backward Compatibility:** Tools will still perform same operations successfully
- **Error Handling:** Error messages will remain informative (only success messages simplified)
## Implementation Completed

### Changes Made:

**1. File Edit Tool Fixed (`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/edit/mod.rs`)**
- **Before:** Complex verbose message with replacements made, bytes written, encoding, line endings, metadata preservation
- **After:** Simple `"OK"` response
- **Line ~450:** Replaced multi-line format string with `let success_message = "OK".to_string();`

**2. File Write Tool Fixed (`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/write/mod.rs`)**
- **Before:** `"Successfully wrote {} bytes to {}"` with technical details
- **After:** Simple `"OK"` response  
- **Line ~193:** Replaced format string with `let success_message = "OK".to_string();`

**3. File Read Tool Analysis (`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/files/read/mod.rs`)**
- **Status:** Already correct - only returns content via `BaseToolImpl::create_success_response(content)`
- **No changes needed:** Debug logging is internal only, doesn't affect response

**4. Tests Updated:**
- **Edit Tool Test:** Updated assertion from checking verbose details to `assert_eq!(response_text, "OK")`
- **Write Tool Test:** Updated assertion from checking verbose details to `assert_eq!(response_text, "OK")`
- **All Tests Pass:** 19 edit tests pass, 16 write tests pass

### Verification Results:
- ✅ File edit operations work correctly with simple "OK" response
- ✅ File write operations work correctly with simple "OK" response  
- ✅ File read operations already working correctly (return content only)
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Error handling remains informative (only success messages simplified)

### Root Cause Resolution:
The issue was **exactly** as described - tools were disobeying the instruction to provide simple responses by including unnecessary technical implementation details. The fix was surgical: change only the success message format while preserving all functionality.

**Principle Applied:** *Do the work correctly, but respond simply*

## Lint Error Resolution - COMPLETED ✅

**Issue Fixed:** Unused import warning for `CommonError` in `swissarmyhammer/src/fs_utils.rs:8`

**Root Cause:** The `CommonError` enum was imported at the module level but only used within test functions, causing a lint warning when building non-test code.

**Solution Applied:** 
- Removed the unused import from the module level
- Added `use crate::error::CommonError;` inside the `#[cfg(test)]` test module where it's actually used
- This ensures the import is only present when running tests

**Verification:**
- ✅ `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` - PASSED (no lint errors)  
- ✅ Build is clean with no warnings or errors

**Files Modified:**
- `swissarmyhammer/src/fs_utils.rs` - Moved CommonError import to test module

**Code Change:**
```rust
// Before (at module level - caused lint error):
use crate::error::{CommonError, Result, SwissArmyHammerError};

// After (module level - clean):
use crate::error::{Result, SwissArmyHammerError};

// After (inside test module - only imported when needed):
#[cfg(test)]
pub mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use crate::error::CommonError;  // Now properly scoped
    // ... rest of tests
}
```

**Impact:** This resolves the lint error while maintaining all test functionality. The build now passes cleanly with strict lint settings (`-D warnings`).
