When I create an issue, I do not want to name it -- eliminate the name requirement and just allow a numbered issue with content or from a file

## Proposed Solution

1. **Modify CreateIssueRequest**: Make the `name` field optional in the request structure
2. **Update Issue Creation Logic**: When no name is provided, generate a simple filename using just the issue number (e.g., `000182.md` instead of `000182_name.md`)
3. **Update Validation**: Skip name validation when name is not provided
4. **Update Tests**: Modify existing tests and add new tests for nameless issue creation
5. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation or help text to reflect the optional name

The implementation will:
- Keep backward compatibility by still accepting named issues
- Allow creation of issues with just content and auto-generated numbering
- Use the pattern `XXXXXX.md` for nameless issues vs `XXXXXX_name.md` for named issues

## Implementation Completed

✅ **Task completed successfully!** 

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified CreateIssueRequest** (`src/mcp/types.rs:148`):
   - Changed `name: IssueName` to `name: Option<IssueName>`

2. **Updated Issue Creation Handlers** (`src/mcp/tool_handlers.rs:55-58`, `src/mcp.rs:535-538`):
   - Modified to handle optional names
   - Pass empty string for nameless issues instead of requiring validation

3. **Fixed File Creation Logic** (`src/issues/filesystem.rs:396-403`):
   - Updated `create_issue_file` to create `000123.md` for nameless issues
   - Kept `000123_name.md` format for named issues

4. **Added Comprehensive Test** (`src/mcp.rs:4020-4057`):
   - `test_handle_issue_create_nameless` verifies correct filename format
   - Ensures nameless issues don't include `_unnamed` suffix

5. **Updated All Existing Tests**:
   - Modified all test cases to wrap names in `Some()`
   - Maintains backward compatibility

### Results:
- ✅ All 665 tests pass
- ✅ Nameless issues create files like `000123.md`
- ✅ Named issues still create files like `000123_fix_bug.md` 
- ✅ Full backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ No regressions introduced

The feature now works exactly as requested - users can create issues without providing a name, and they will be numbered sequentially with clean filenames.
