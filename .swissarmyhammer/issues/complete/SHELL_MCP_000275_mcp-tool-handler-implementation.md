# MCP Tool Handler Implementation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-shell/ideas/shell.md

## Overview

Implement the complete MCP tool handler that integrates the shell execution engine with the MCP protocol, following the established patterns used by other tools in the system.

## Objective

Create the MCP tool handler function that processes incoming tool requests, validates parameters, executes shell commands, and returns properly formatted MCP responses.

## Requirements

### MCP Tool Handler Function
- Implement the main tool handler following existing patterns
- Handle parameter parsing and validation
- Integrate with the shell execution engine
- Return properly formatted MCP responses

### Parameter Validation
- Validate all incoming parameters against the JSON schema
- Provide clear error messages for invalid parameters
- Handle optional parameters with appropriate defaults
- Sanitize input parameters for security

### Response Formatting
- Format successful execution responses per specification
- Handle error responses with appropriate metadata
- Include comprehensive execution information
- Follow existing MCP response patterns

### Tool Registration
- Register the tool with the MCP tool registry
- Provide proper tool metadata and descriptions
- Integrate with the existing tool discovery system
- Follow naming and registration conventions

## Implementation Details

### MCP Tool Handler Structure
```rust
use serde_json::{json, Value};

pub async fn shell_execute_handler(
    args: Value
) -> Result<Value, Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    // Parse and validate parameters
    let params = parse_shell_parameters(args)?;
    
    // Execute shell command
    let result = execute_shell_command(
        params.command,
        params.working_directory,
        params.timeout,
        params.environment
    ).await?;
    
    // Format MCP response
    format_shell_response(result)
}
```

### Parameter Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct ShellParameters {
    command: String,
    working_directory: Option<String>,
    #[serde(default = "default_timeout")]
    timeout: u64,
    environment: Option<HashMap<String, String>>,
}

fn default_timeout() -> u64 { 300 }
```

### Response Formatting
Follow the specification response format:
```rust
fn format_shell_response(
    result: ShellExecutionResult
) -> Result<Value, ShellError> {
    Ok(json!({
        "content": [{
            "type": "text",
            "text": if result.exit_code == 0 {
                "Command executed successfully"
            } else {
                format!("Command failed with exit code {}", result.exit_code)
            }
        }],
        "is_error": result.exit_code != 0,
        "metadata": {
            "command": result.command,
            "exit_code": result.exit_code,
            "stdout": result.stdout,
            "stderr": result.stderr,
            "execution_time_ms": result.execution_time_ms,
            "working_directory": result.working_directory.display().to_string()
        }
    }))
}
```

## Integration Points

### Existing Tool Patterns
- Study `issues/create/mod.rs` and other tool implementations
- Follow the same parameter parsing patterns
- Use consistent error handling approaches
- Maintain the same response formatting style

### Tool Registry Integration
- Add to `tool_registry.rs` following existing patterns
- Provide proper tool metadata
- Ensure tool appears in MCP tool lists
- Follow naming conventions for tool identification

### Error Handling Integration
- Integrate with existing MCP error handling patterns
- Use consistent error response formats
- Provide detailed error context
- Follow established error propagation patterns

## Security Integration

### Input Validation
- Validate command strings for basic safety
- Check parameter bounds and formats
- Sanitize directory and environment inputs
- Prevent obvious injection patterns

### Audit Logging
- Log all shell command executions
- Include user context and execution details
- Log security-relevant events
- Follow existing logging patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP tool handler implemented following existing patterns
- [ ] Parameter validation works correctly
- [ ] Response formatting matches specification
- [ ] Tool registration integrated with registry
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive and consistent
- [ ] Security validation prevents basic attacks
- [ ] Audit logging captures execution details
- [ ] Integration with existing tool architecture

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for parameter validation
- [ ] Tests for response formatting
- [ ] Integration tests with MCP protocol
- [ ] Security tests for input validation
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Tool registration tests

## Notes

- This step brings together all the previous shell execution components
- Focus on proper MCP protocol integration and response formatting
- Ensure consistency with existing tool implementations
- Security validation is basic at this stage - comprehensive security comes later
- The tool should be fully functional after this step

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase and MCP tool patterns, I can see that the shell execution tool is already fully implemented. The issue description was requesting implementation of the MCP tool handler, but upon examination, the complete implementation already exists at:

`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/shell/execute/mod.rs`

This implementation includes:

### Already Implemented Features
1. **Complete MCP Tool Handler**: `ShellExecuteTool` struct implementing the `McpTool` trait
2. **Parameter Validation**: Full JSON schema validation and security checks
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Multiple error types with detailed context
4. **Process Management**: `AsyncProcessGuard` for automatic cleanup
5. **Security Validation**: Integration with workflow security validation functions
6. **Response Formatting**: Proper MCP response format per specification
7. **Extensive Testing**: 30+ comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios

### Current Implementation Status
- The tool is properly registered in the MCP tool registry
- It follows all established patterns from other tools in the codebase
- Security validation includes command injection prevention, path traversal protection, and environment variable validation
- Timeout management with graceful process termination
- Full stdout/stderr capture with execution metadata
- Rate limiting integration
- Comprehensive audit logging through the tracing system

### Analysis Conclusion
The MCP tool handler implementation is already complete and fully functional. This issue appears to be describing work that has already been completed in previous development phases.

The implementation demonstrates:
- Mature error handling with comprehensive error types
- Proper async process management with cleanup
- Security-first approach with multiple validation layers
- Full MCP protocol compliance
- Extensive test coverage including security validation tests

No additional implementation work is needed for the MCP tool handler as it already exists and is fully functional.

   - Timeout handling tests
   - Error condition tests
   - Tool registration tests

2. **Code Quality**: 
   - All code properly formatted with `cargo fmt`

   - Tool is properly registered in the MCP tool registry
   - `register_shell_tools()` is called in the MCP server initialization
   - Tool appears in MCP tool lists and is available for use
   - Binary builds and runs successfully

4. **Security Implementation**:
   - Command injection prevention (validates against dangerous patterns)
   - Path traversal protection (prevents `../` and absolute path attacks)
   - Environment variable validation (proper naming and length limits)
   - Working directory security checks
   - Comprehensive audit logging

5. **Feature Completeness**:
   - Full parameter validation with JSON schema
   - Async process management with cleanup
   - Timeout handling with graceful termination
   - Complete stdout/stderr capture
