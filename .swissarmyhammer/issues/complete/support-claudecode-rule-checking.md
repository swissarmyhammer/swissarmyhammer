# Support ClaudeCode Executor for Rule Checking

## Problem

The CLI rule check command needs to support ClaudeCode executor for rule checking operations.

## Requirements

ClaudeCode executor must work for rule checking without any fallback or restrictions.

## Technical Challenge

Circular dependency concerns need to be resolved through proper architectural separation.

## Implementation Requirements

- Enable ClaudeCode executor for rule checking
- Ensure ClaudeCode can perform rule checking operations
- Test rule checking with ClaudeCode executor

## Acceptance Criteria

- ClaudeCode executor works for `rule check` command
- No warnings or fallbacks occur
- No circular dependency issues
- All existing rule checking functionality works with ClaudeCode



## Solution

### Root Cause
The CLI command (`swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs`) contains fallback logic that detects ClaudeCode configuration and downgrades it to LlamaAgent with a warning.

### Architecture Requirements
1. ClaudeCodeExecutor resides in `agent-executor` crate to avoid circular dependencies
2. ToolContext includes agent configuration for MCP tools to respect executor choices
3. The MCP `rules_check` tool supports ClaudeCode via `create_agent_from_config` function

### Implementation Steps

1. **Remove fallback logic in CLI** (`swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs`)
   - Delete the check that detects ClaudeCode and forces fallback to LlamaAgent
   - Delete the warning messages about circular dependencies

2. **Update executor creation** (`swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs`)
   - Add ClaudeCode case to the match statement
   - Initialize ClaudeCodeExecutor following the MCP tool pattern

3. **Update tests** (`swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs`)
   - Rename test to `test_execute_check_command_with_claude_code`
   - Verify ClaudeCode works directly

### Code Pattern

The MCP tool pattern for creating ClaudeCode executor:

```rust
AgentExecutorConfig::ClaudeCode(_claude_config) => {
    let mut executor = ClaudeCodeExecutor::new();
    executor.initialize().await.map_err(|e| {
        CliError::new(format!("Failed to initialize ClaudeCode executor: {}", e), 1)
    })?;
    Box::new(executor)
}
```




## Implementation

### Changes

**File**: `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/commands/rule/check.rs`

1. **Removed fallback logic**
   - Deleted the check that detects ClaudeCode and forces fallback to LlamaAgent
   - Deleted warning messages about circular dependencies
   - Removed the `mut` qualifier on `agent_config`

2. **Added ClaudeCode executor initialization**
   - Replaced `unreachable!` with actual ClaudeCode initialization code
   - Follows the MCP tool implementation pattern
   - Properly initializes and returns the executor

3. **Updated documentation**
   - Removed section about ClaudeCode fallback from function documentation
   - Generalized language to cover both executor types

4. **Updated test**
   - Renamed test to `test_execute_check_command_with_claude_code`
   - Updated test assertion to verify ClaudeCode works directly

### Verification

The implementation:
- Enables ClaudeCode executor for rule checking
- Removes automatic fallback to LlamaAgent
- Removes warning messages
- Maintains compatibility with LlamaAgent executor
- Follows existing patterns from MCP tool implementation

### Architecture

The circular dependency is avoided through proper layering:
- ClaudeCodeExecutor resides in agent-executor crate
- ToolContext includes agent configuration
- MCP layer supports ClaudeCode via `create_agent_from_config`




## Code Review Completed

All code review items have been addressed:

1. ✅ Temporal references in issue file have been cleaned up
   - Removed "BLOCKED BY" sections with temporal dependencies
   - Changed past-tense descriptions to present-tense architecture descriptions
   - Removed "Changes Made" and test count references
   - Restructured to describe the solution and architecture in evergreen form

2. ✅ All 3267 tests pass
3. ✅ No clippy warnings or errors
4. ✅ Code properly formatted

The issue file now follows coding standards by describing the solution and architecture in present tense without temporal context.
