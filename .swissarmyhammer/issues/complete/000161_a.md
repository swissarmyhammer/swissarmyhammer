Eliminate any retry logic in prompts or workflows.

Claude itself has retry logic when we call prompts so this is redundant.

## Proposed Solution

Based on comprehensive analysis of the codebase, I found retry logic implemented at multiple layers:

### Current Retry Logic Locations:
1. **Core Workflow Executor** (`workflow/executor/core.rs`) - sophisticated retry with exponential backoff
2. **Action-Level Retry** (`workflow/actions.rs`) - trait-based retry system for prompt/workflow actions
3. **MCP Server File System** (`mcp.rs`) - file system operation resilience
4. **MCP Error Handling** (`mcp/error_handling.rs`) - specialized error handler
5. **Workflow-Level Configuration** - metadata-driven retry settings

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Remove Redundant Claude API Retry Logic**
- Remove workflow executor retry logic for prompt/Claude API calls
- Remove action-level retry patterns that wrap Claude API interactions
- Remove retry configuration from workflow metadata (retry_max_attempts, retry_backoff_ms, etc.)
- Update workflow executor to directly call actions without retry wrapper

**Phase 2: Preserve Essential System Retry Logic**
- Keep MCP server file system retry logic (local file operations)
- Keep MCP error handling retry for system-level operations
- Keep any retry logic for non-Claude external service calls

**Phase 3: Update Documentation and Tests**
- Remove retry examples from workflow documentation
- Update error handling documentation to reflect Claude's built-in retry
- Remove retry-specific test workflows
- Update action trait definitions to remove retry methods

**Phase 4: Refactor Code Architecture**
- Simplify action execution flow by removing retry wrapper functions
- Clean up error handling to rely on Claude's retry mechanism
- Remove retry configuration parsing from workflow metadata
- Update action traits to remove retry-related methods

This approach eliminates redundant retry logic while preserving necessary system-level retry for non-Claude operations.
