# Implement Redirect Handling and Tracking

## Overview
Add comprehensive HTTP redirect handling with redirect chain tracking and limits as specified in the web_fetch tool specification. Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-fetch/ideas/fetch.md.

## Tasks
- Configure markdowndown client for redirect handling
- Track redirect chains and count redirects
- Set maximum redirect limit (10 as per specification)
- Return redirect information in response metadata
- Handle different redirect status codes (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)

## Implementation Details
- Configure client max_redirects based on follow_redirects parameter
- Capture and track redirect chain with status codes
- Include redirect_count and redirect_chain in response metadata
- Return final_url in response to show redirect destination
- Handle redirect loops and excessive redirects

## Success Criteria
- Redirects are followed correctly when enabled
- Redirect chains are tracked and reported
- Maximum redirect limit prevents infinite loops
- Response includes redirect metadata as per specification
- Different redirect types are handled appropriately

## Dependencies
- Requires fetch_000005_parameter-validation (for parameter support)

## Estimated Impact
- Enables handling of URLs with redirects
- Provides transparency about redirect behavior
## Proposed Solution

I have implemented comprehensive redirect handling and tracking for the web_fetch tool with the following approach:

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Custom HTTP Client with Manual Redirect Handling**: 
   - Replaced markdowndown's automatic redirect handling with a custom `fetch_with_redirect_tracking` method
   - Uses reqwest with `redirect(reqwest::redirect::Policy::none())` to handle redirects manually
   - Provides complete control over redirect tracking and chain building

2. **Redirect Chain Tracking**:
   - Created `RedirectStep` struct to track each step (URL + status code)
   - Created `RedirectInfo` struct to track count, chain, and final URL
   - Tracks all redirect steps including the final successful request

3. **Response Format Enhancement**:
   - Returns redirect information only when redirects occurred (`redirect_count > 0`)
   - Includes `redirect_count` and `redirect_chain` in metadata as per specification  
   - Formats redirect chain as `"URL -> STATUS_CODE"` strings
   - Updates `final_url` to show actual destination after redirects

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   - Enforces maximum redirect limit (10 redirects when `follow_redirects: true`, 0 when `false`)
   - Handles relative redirects by resolving them against the current base URL
   - Provides clear error messages for redirect loops and excessive redirects
   - Maintains all existing error categorization and suggestion functionality

5. **Enhanced Testing Coverage**:
   - Added 12+ comprehensive unit tests covering redirect structures, chain formatting, status code handling, and response metadata
   - Tests validate redirect counting logic, URL parsing, error message formatting
   - Ensures specification compliance for redirect response format

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Redirect Chain Tracking**: Complete chain of redirects with status codes  
✅ **Maximum Redirect Limit**: Enforces 10 redirect maximum as per specification  
✅ **Status Code Support**: Handles all redirect codes (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)  
✅ **Relative URL Resolution**: Properly resolves relative redirect locations  
✅ **Response Metadata**: Includes redirect_count and redirect_chain when redirects occur  
✅ **Success Message Enhancement**: Shows redirect count in success messages  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 32 unit tests pass including new redirect functionality  

### Response Format Example

**No Redirects Response:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "final_url": "https://example.com", 
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "markdown_content": "..."
}
```

**With Redirects Response:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/old",
  "final_url": "https://example.com/new",
  "redirect_count": 2,
  "redirect_chain": [
    "https://example.com/old -> 301",
    "https://example.com/temp -> 302", 
    "https://example.com/new -> 200"
  ],
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "markdown_content": "..."
}
```

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements in the specification and provides robust redirect handling with comprehensive tracking capabilities.
## Implementation Complete ✅

All redirect handling functionality has been successfully implemented and tested:

### Completed Features

✅ **Custom Redirect Tracking**: Implemented manual redirect handling with complete chain tracking  
✅ **Maximum Redirect Limits**: Enforces 10 redirects max when enabled, 0 when disabled  
✅ **All Redirect Status Codes**: Supports 301, 302, 303, 307, 308 redirects  
✅ **Response Metadata**: Includes `redirect_count` and `redirect_chain` when redirects occur  
✅ **Relative URL Resolution**: Properly resolves relative redirects against base URLs  
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for redirect loops and limits exceeded  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 32 unit tests pass, including 12 new redirect-specific tests  
✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated tool description with redirect handling capabilities  

### Code Quality

- **Zero Compilation Warnings**: Clean build with proper documentation
- **All Tests Pass**: 174 total tests pass including new redirect functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing web_fetch API
- **Specification Compliance**: Fully implements redirect response format from ideas/fetch.md

The implementation provides robust redirect handling that meets all requirements while maintaining the tool's existing functionality and security features.

## Code Review Fixes - ✅ COMPLETED

Successfully resolved all clippy lint violations and formatting issues identified in the code review:

### Fixed Issues:

✅ **Manual Range Contains** (lines 83, 1097, 1104):
   - Replaced `status_code >= 300 && status_code < 400` with `(300..400).contains(&status_code)`
   - Applied to both main code and test assertions

✅ **Uninlined Format Args** (lines 85, 136, 1097, 1104, 1157):  
   - Updated all `format!("text {}", variable)` to `format!("text {variable}")` 
   - Restructured complex format calls by extracting variables first
   - Applied to error messages, content formatting, and test assertions

✅ **Useless Vec Usage** (line 1176):
   - Replaced `vec!["item1", "item2"]` with array literal `["item1", "item2"]`
   - Maintained functionality while reducing unnecessary allocation

✅ **Code Formatting**:
   - Successfully ran `cargo fmt --all` - all code properly formatted
   - Consistent indentation and spacing throughout the module

✅ **Clippy Verification**:
   - `cargo clippy` runs clean with no warnings or errors
   - All lint issues resolved without breaking functionality

✅ **Test Verification**:
   - All web_fetch tests passing (32/32 redirect and validation tests)
   - Redirect functionality works correctly with all fixes applied
   - No regressions in existing functionality

### Implementation Quality

The redirect handling implementation remains **functionally complete and well-designed**:

- ✅ Comprehensive redirect tracking with full chain management
- ✅ Support for all redirect status codes (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)  
- ✅ Maximum redirect limits (10 when enabled, 0 when disabled)
- ✅ Proper relative URL resolution and error handling
- ✅ Specification-compliant response format with redirect metadata
- ✅ Extensive test coverage with clean, maintainable code

The code is now **ready for production use** with all lint issues resolved while maintaining the robust redirect handling functionality specified in the requirements.
