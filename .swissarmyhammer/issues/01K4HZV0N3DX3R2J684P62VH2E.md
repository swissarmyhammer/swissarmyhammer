# Fix memo_create to return memo ID instead of just OK

## Problem

The `memo_create` tool currently returns a generic "OK" response without providing the ID of the newly created memo. This makes it difficult for users to reference or work with the memo they just created.

## Expected Behavior

The `memo_create` tool should return the unique ULID identifier of the created memo, allowing users to:
- Reference the memo in subsequent operations
- Know the exact ID for memo_get, memo_update, or memo_delete operations
- Have confirmation of successful creation with actionable information

## Current Implementation

The tool likely returns a simple success message without the memo ID.

## Solution

Update `memo_create` to return:
1. Success confirmation message
2. The newly created memo's ULID identifier
3. Optionally include other memo metadata (title, creation timestamp)

## Files to Update

- `swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/memoranda/create/mod.rs`
- Related response types and schemas

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `memo_create` returns the new memo's ULID identifier
- [ ] Response includes clear confirmation of successful creation
- [ ] Response format is consistent with other memo tools
- [ ] Tests updated to verify ID is returned
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
