# Remove notify_create References from Builtin Prompts

## Parent Issue
Eliminate notify_create Tool and Replace with Native MCP Notifications (01K7SHXK4XKMDREMXG7BFJ8YJ7)

## Summary
Remove notify_create tool references from builtin prompt templates.

## Locations
- `builtin/prompts/are_tests_passing.md`
- `builtin/prompts/test.md`

## Tasks

1. Check `builtin/prompts/are_tests_passing.md` for notify_create references
   - If found, remove or update to not mention the tool
   - Prompts should not instruct LLM to call notify_create

2. Check `builtin/prompts/test.md` for notify_create references
   - If found, remove or update to not mention the tool
   - Prompts should not instruct LLM to call notify_create

3. Update prompts to reflect that:
   - Progress notifications are sent automatically by tools
   - LLM does not need to explicitly notify users
   - Tools handle progress updates transparently

## Example Update

If a prompt says:
```markdown
After running tests, use notify_create to inform the user of the results.
```

Change to:
```markdown
After running tests, report the results in your response.
```

Or simply remove the notification instruction entirely, as the shell tool will send progress notifications automatically.

## Dependencies

Must be completed **after**:
- Phase 1: Implement MCP Progress Notification Infrastructure (01K7SHZ4203SMD2C6HTW1QV3ZP)

## Verification

- [ ] All notify_create references removed from prompts
- [ ] Prompts do not instruct LLM to call removed tool
- [ ] Prompts reflect current notification architecture
- [ ] `sah prompt list` shows updated prompts
