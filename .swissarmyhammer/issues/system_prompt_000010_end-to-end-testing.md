# End-to-End System Prompt Testing and Validation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/system_prompt.md

## Overview
Comprehensive end-to-end testing to validate that the system prompt infrastructure works correctly across all use cases and that the removal of template includes doesn't degrade functionality.

## Prerequisites
- All previous system_prompt issues completed
- `.system.md` file renamed and working
- Template includes removed from all prompts
- CLI integration implemented and deployed

## Testing Scope

### 1. System Prompt Functionality
- **Rendering**: Verify `.system.md` renders with all includes (principals, coding_standards, tool_use)
- **Content Validation**: Confirm rendered content matches expected standards
- **Template Resolution**: Verify all template includes resolve correctly
- **Error Handling**: Test behavior with broken templates or missing includes

### 2. Claude Code Integration
- **Parameter Injection**: Verify `--append-system-prompt` receives rendered content
- **Content Delivery**: Confirm Claude Code receives complete system prompt
- **CLI Compatibility**: Ensure all existing CLI functionality works
- **Error Scenarios**: Test behavior when system prompt rendering fails

### 3. Prompt Functionality After Include Removal
Test each category of prompts that had template includes removed:

#### Root Prompts (3 files)
- `test.md` - Verify testing guidance works without explicit includes
- `coverage.md` - Confirm coverage analysis maintains quality
- `plan.md` - Ensure planning prompts provide adequate guidance

#### Review Prompts (6 files)  
- `review/security.md` - Security review quality maintained
- `review/code.md` - Code review effectiveness preserved
- `review/patterns.md` - Pattern analysis still comprehensive
- `review/placeholders.md` - Placeholder detection working
- `review/accessibility.md` - Accessibility review thorough

#### Issue Prompts (3 files)
- `issue/review.md` - Issue review process effective
- `issue/code.md` - Issue coding guidance adequate
- `issue/code_review.md` - Issue code review comprehensive

#### Documentation Prompts (5 files)
- `docs/review.md` - Documentation review quality maintained
- `docs/readme.md` - README generation meets standards  
- `docs/correct.md` - Documentation correction effective
- `docs/project.md` - Project documentation comprehensive
- `docs/comments.md` - Code comment guidance adequate

### 4. Workflow Integration Testing
- **Complete Workflows**: Test full workflows that use multiple prompts
- **Standards Application**: Verify coding standards apply consistently
- **Quality Maintenance**: Confirm output quality matches pre-change levels
- **Error Handling**: Test workflow behavior with system prompt issues

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Baseline Comparison
- **Before/After Analysis**: Compare prompt outputs before and after changes
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure consistency and completeness of guidance
- **Standards Coverage**: Verify all standards topics are still covered
- **Functionality Preservation**: Confirm no feature regression

### 2. Real-World Scenarios
- **Actual Code Review**: Use prompts on real code for quality assessment
- **Documentation Generation**: Generate documentation with updated prompts
- **Issue Workflows**: Complete full issue development cycles
- **Standards Compliance**: Verify generated content meets established standards

### 3. Edge Case Testing
- **Template Failures**: Test with broken system prompt templates
- **Missing Includes**: Test behavior with missing template partials
- **Rendering Errors**: Verify graceful degradation with rendering failures
- **CLI Errors**: Test system prompt integration error scenarios

## Success Criteria

## Test Deliverables
- Comprehensive test report covering all scenarios
- Performance analysis and benchmarks

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **Quality Degradation**: Monitor output quality and adjust if needed
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize system prompt rendering
- **Integration Failures**: Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- **User Experience**: Ensure changes are transparent to end users

## Proposed Solution

I will implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for the system prompt infrastructure using the following approach:

### 1. Test Framework Development
- Create a dedicated test suite in `tests/e2e/system_prompt_test.rs`
- Implement helper functions for prompt rendering and content validation
- Set up test fixtures for various scenarios (valid/invalid templates, missing includes)
- Create baseline comparison utilities

### 2. System Prompt Core Testing
- Test `.system.md` rendering with all template includes
- Validate that principals, coding_standards, and tool_use are properly included
- Verify template resolution works correctly
- Test error handling for broken templates and missing includes

### 3. Claude Code Integration Testing
- Test `--append-system-prompt` parameter functionality
- Verify complete system prompt content delivery to Claude Code
- Validate CLI compatibility with existing functionality
- Test error scenarios when system prompt rendering fails

### 4. Prompt Quality Validation
- Test all 17 prompts that had template includes removed
- Compare output quality before/after include removal
- Verify standards are still effectively communicated
- Validate that guidance remains comprehensive

### 5. Workflow Integration Testing
- Test complete development workflows using updated prompts
- Validate coding standards application consistency
- Test error handling in workflow contexts
- Measure performance impact of system prompt integration

### 6. Automated Test Suite
- Create automated tests that can be run as part of CI/CD
- Include performance benchmarks and regression detection
- Generate detailed test reports with pass/fail criteria
- Implement quality metrics tracking

This approach ensures thorough validation of the system prompt infrastructure while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive error handling.
