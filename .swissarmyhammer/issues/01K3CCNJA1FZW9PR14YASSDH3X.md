the claude_code_integration is a giant pile of mess compared to just rendering and passing the system prompt in actions.rs 

plus reading the code I just don't even believe you that we're running our prompt action in actions rs with the --append-system-prompt switch -- it looks like we are running claude twice.

fix this

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the code, the issue is that we have two separate layers trying to handle system prompt injection:

1. **claude_code_integration.rs**: Complex module that finds Claude CLI, renders system prompt, and adds `--append-system-prompt` parameter
2. **actions.rs**: Already has access to prompt rendering infrastructure and could directly render and include system prompt

The problem is that this creates unnecessary complexity and potential for double execution.

**Solution**: Remove the claude_code_integration.rs complexity and directly render system prompt in actions.rs where we already have the template infrastructure.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Remove claude_code_integration dependency** from actions.rs
2. **Add direct system prompt rendering** in the prompt action execution 
3. **Combine rendered prompt with system prompt** directly in the template context
4. **Execute Claude directly** with the combined prompt instead of using the complex integration layer
5. **Clean up unused claude_code_integration.rs** or mark for removal

This approach:
- Eliminates the redundancy
- Removes the complex CLI parameter injection
- Uses the existing template infrastructure more efficiently
- Removes risk of double Claude execution
- Simplifies the codebase significantly

## Implementation Complete ✅

Successfully simplified the Claude Code integration by:

### What was removed:
- Removed dependency on `claude_code_integration::ClaudeCodeInvocation` from `actions.rs`
- Eliminated the complex `--append-system-prompt` parameter injection approach
- Removed redundant configuration and path finding logic

### What was implemented:
1. **Direct system prompt rendering** in `actions.rs` using existing `render_system_prompt()` function
2. **Simple prompt combination** - system prompt + user prompt concatenated directly
3. **Direct Claude CLI execution** using `tokio::process::Command` instead of the complex integration layer
4. **Graceful fallback** - if system prompt rendering fails, continues with just the user prompt

### Key improvements:
- **Eliminates redundancy** - no more double system prompt handling
- **Removes complexity** - direct CLI execution instead of layered approach  
- **Better error handling** - system prompt failures are non-blocking warnings
- **Cleaner code** - uses existing template infrastructure more efficiently
- **Same functionality** - system prompt integration still works, just simpler

### Code changes made:
- `actions.rs:6`: Changed import from `claude_code_integration` to `system_prompt::render_system_prompt`
- `actions.rs:405-466`: Replaced complex integration logic with direct approach
- All tests pass ✅
- No clippy warnings ✅

The issue is now **resolved**. The `claude_code_integration.rs` complexity has been eliminated in favor of direct system prompt rendering in `actions.rs` where we already have all the necessary infrastructure.
## Issue Resolution: ✅ COMPLETE

Successfully fixed the Claude Code integration complexity by completely removing the `claude_code_integration.rs` layer and implementing direct system prompt rendering in `actions.rs`.

## What was accomplished:

### 1. **Removed Dead Code Completely** ✅
- **Deleted** `swissarmyhammer/src/claude_code_integration.rs` entirely (400+ lines removed)
- **Removed** all exports from `lib.rs` 
- **Updated** integration tests to test the actual `actions.rs` implementation instead of deleted module

### 2. **Refactored actions.rs for Maintainability** ✅ 
- **Extracted** `execute_claude_cli()` method for clean Claude execution
- **Extracted** `prepare_final_prompt()` method for system prompt handling
- **Added** `get_claude_path()` method for configuration consolidation
- **Replaced** temp file approach with stdin (more consistent with Claude CLI patterns)

### 3. **Configuration Improvements** ✅
- Claude CLI path configurable via context variables and environment (`SAH_CLAUDE_PATH`)
- System prompt injection configurable via context and environment (`SAH_CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_ENABLED`)
- Proper defaults and fallback behavior implemented

### 4. **Code Quality Improvements** ✅
- Eliminated redundancy between two system prompt handling approaches
- Removed risk of double Claude execution 
- Consistent error handling with `ActionError::ClaudeError`
- Better error context including Claude CLI path and arguments
- All tests passing ✅
- No clippy warnings ✅
- Code properly formatted ✅

## Key Technical Changes:

### Before (Complex):
- 400+ line `claude_code_integration.rs` module with builder pattern
- Complex `--append-system-prompt` parameter injection
- Dual system prompt handling paths
- Temp file approach for Claude CLI
- Separate configuration objects and error types

### After (Simple):
- ~60 lines of clean, focused methods in `actions.rs`
- Direct system prompt rendering using existing infrastructure  
- Single system prompt handling path
- Stdin approach for Claude CLI (standard pattern)
- Reuse of existing configuration and error handling

## Result:
- ✅ **Issue goal achieved**: "giant pile of mess" eliminated
- ✅ **No double Claude execution**: simplified to single execution path
- ✅ **Better maintainability**: uses existing template infrastructure efficiently  
- ✅ **Same functionality**: system prompt integration still works
- ✅ **Cleaner codebase**: removed 400+ lines of unnecessary complexity

The Claude Code integration is now much simpler and more maintainable while providing the same system prompt injection functionality.
