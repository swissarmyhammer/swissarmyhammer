Ignored tests are strictly forbidden.

Any ignored test should be corrected if possible, or deleted.

One common (invalid) reason for ignoring a test would be an exernal dependency or the impression that it will 'cost money'. In this case the correct resolution is to call the API or dependency and save the results and make a playback test.
