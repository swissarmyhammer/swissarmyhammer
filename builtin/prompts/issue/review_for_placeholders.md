## Rules

DO NOT code now, the goal is just to create issues

## Process

- Review all the source code and use the issue_create tool to create an issue for each placeholder or todo you found on the code.
  - Look for TODO
  - Look for placeholder
  - Look for not implemented
  - Look for not supported
  - Look for language referring to later implementation
- Look at the current issues, do not duplicate an issue
- Report your progress
