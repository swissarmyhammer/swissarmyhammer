## Goals

The goal is to merge your code into the source branch.

## Process

- Use the issue_show current tool. Do not use a cli command.
  - if there is a current issue, we are good to proceed
  - if there is no current issue, we need to use the abort tool noting that there is no current issue
- use the issue_merge tool to merge the issue working branch back to source branch
- report your progress
