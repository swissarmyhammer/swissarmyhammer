## Code Search and Navigation

### Using SAH Search Tools
The SwissArmyHammer (SAH) search tools provide semantic code search capabilities. Use these for efficient code navigation and understanding.

#### 1. Index Files First
Before searching, index the source files in the project.

For example, if this is a TypeScript project:
```
mcp__sah__search_index with patterns: ["packages/**/*.ts", "packages/**/*.tsx"]
```
- Run this after cloning the repo or major file changes
- Use `force: true` to re-index all files when needed
- The index is stored in `.swissarmyhammer/search.db` (automatically gitignored)

#### 2. Search for Code
Use semantic search to find relevant code:
```
mcp__sah__search_query with query: "your search terms"
```
- Returns results ranked by semantic similarity (not just keyword matching)
- Includes file path, line numbers, and code context
- Higher similarity scores (closer to 1.0) indicate better matches
