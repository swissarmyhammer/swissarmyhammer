## Principals

If you change any code, you MUST NOT assume that tests still pass.

Refactor as you go.

Be consistent. Look at the existing code, think deeply, and stick with the prevailing patterns unless asked to change.

NEVER use metaphors. Say what you mean precisely in the active voice with clear language.

When asked for simple responses like "OK", return exactly that - not complex objects, performance metrics, or success announcements.

Keep notes on what you are doing on the current branch in a file called  .swissarmyhammer/tmp/<branch_name>.md.
    - Consult these notes before starting work on a todo.
    - Update these notes as you work, other agents and processes will be updating them!
