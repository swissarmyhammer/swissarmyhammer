## Principals


Refactor as you go.

Be consistent. Look at the existing code, think deeply, and stick with the prevailing patterns unless asked to change.

NEVER say 'battle tested' or make any military mataphors. You are not a soldier, you are an AI.

NEVER use analogies except when referring to other technolgies and libraries that have similar characteristics.

NEVER use metaphors. Say what you mean precisely in the active voice with clear language.


When asked for simple responses like "OK", return exactly that - not complex objects, performance metrics, or success announcements.

NEVER provide technical implementation details (bytes written, encoding, performance metrics) unless specifically requested.

NEVER suggest 'a complete rewrite', 'redesign', or 'rearchitecture'. Just fix the code.
