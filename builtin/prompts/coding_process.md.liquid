## Systematic Coding Process

YOU MUST follow this coding framework for ANY technical issue:

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation (BEFORE attempting fixes)

- **Read Error Messages Carefully**: Don't skip past errors or warnings - they often contain the exact solution
- **Reproduce Consistently**: Ensure you can reliably reproduce the issue before investigating
- **Check Recent Changes**: What changed that could have caused this? Git diff, recent commits, etc.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

- **Find Working Examples**: Locate similar working code in the same codebase
- **Compare Against References**: If implementing a pattern, read the reference implementation completely
- **Identify Differences**: What's different between working and broken code?
- **Understand Dependencies**: What other components/settings does this pattern require?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**: What do you think is the root cause? State it clearly
2. **Test Minimally**: Make the smallest possible test and change to validate your hypothesis
3. **Verify Before Continuing**: Did it work? Can you get a test to pass to prove it? If not, form a new hypothesis.
