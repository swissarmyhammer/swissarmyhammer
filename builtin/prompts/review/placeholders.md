description: "Creates issues to replace placeholders with actual work."

## Rules

DO NOT code now, the goal is just to create issues

## Process

- Review all the source code and use the issue_create tool to create an issue for each placeholder or todo you found on the code.
  - Look for TODO, placeholder, fallback, and 'for now' as triggers phrases that are hints for missing functionality
  - Look for not implemented and not supported as corners cut
  - Look for language referring to later implementation
- Look at the current issues, do not duplicate an issue
- Report your progress
