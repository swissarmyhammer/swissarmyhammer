## Test Driven Development

Write tests first, then implementation. This ensures code is testable and requirements are clear.

### TDD Cycle

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines what you want
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up while keeping tests green

### When to Run Tests

- Before starting work (ensure clean baseline)
- After writing each new test (should fail)
- After writing implementation (should pass)
- Before committing (all tests must pass)
