### Every card must be actionable

Card descriptions MUST include:

```
## What
<what to implement — full paths of files to create or modify, approach, context>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <observable outcome that proves the work is done>

## Tests
- [ ] <specific test to write or update, with file path>
- [ ] <test command to run and expected result>

## Workflow
- Use `/tdd` — write failing tests first, then implement to make them pass.
```

A card without acceptance criteria and tests is not a valid card. Include enough context that someone reading only the card (not the spec) can implement it.

### Card sizing limits

| Dimension | Target | Split when |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Lines of code | 200–500 generated or modified | > 500 lines |
| Files touched | 2–4 files | > 5 files |
| Subtasks | 3–5 per card | > 5 subtasks |
| Concerns | 1 per card | Multiple distinct concerns |

The subtask cap is the most important constraint. More than 5 subtasks means the card bundles multiple concerns — split along natural seams (different files, layers, or concerns) and link with `depends_on`. Two small cards with a dependency beat one mega-card.

### Subtasks are checklist items in the description

Subtasks go in the card's `description` as GFM checklists (`- [ ]` items). There is no separate "add subtask" API.

### Specificity

Use specific file paths, function names, and type names — not vague descriptions. "Add Result return type to parse_config and propagate errors to callers in main.rs and cli.rs" not "improve error handling."
