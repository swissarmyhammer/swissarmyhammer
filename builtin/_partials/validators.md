## Validator Feedback

Validators are automated quality gates that run on your code changes. When a validator blocks you (e.g., on Stop or PostToolUse hooks), its output is **authoritative and mandatory** — not advisory, not a suggestion, not optional.

**Validator feedback is part of your task.** A task is not done until all validators pass. Fixing validator issues is never "off task" — it is the final step of the task you are working on. Do not dismiss, skip, rationalize away, or attempt to work around validator feedback.

When a validator blocks:

1. **Read the full message.** Understand exactly what the validator flagged and why.
2. **Fix every issue it raised.** Apply the specific fixes the validator describes. Do not partially address them.
3. **Re-verify.** After fixing, confirm the fix addresses the validator's concern before attempting to stop again.

**Never treat validator output as:**
- A distraction from your "real" task
- Something that can be deferred to a follow-up task
- An incorrect or overzealous check that you can override
- Noise that should be acknowledged but not acted on

If a validator flags something you genuinely believe is a false positive, explain your reasoning to the user and ask for guidance — do not silently ignore it.
