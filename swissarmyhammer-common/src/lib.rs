//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`constants`] - Shared constants used throughout the ecosystem
//! - [`traits`] - Common trait definitions for shared behaviors  
//! - [`types`] - Core type definitions and newtypes for domain safety
//! - [`utils`] - Utility functions and helpers
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! This crate follows the SwissArmyHammer architectural principles:
//! - Type safety through newtypes and strong typing
//! - Comprehensive error handling with structured error types
//! - Serialization support for all public types
//! - Documentation-driven development with clear API contracts
