//! # Common Utility Functions
//!
//! This module provides utility functions and helper routines used throughout
//! the SwissArmyHammer ecosystem. These utilities are designed to be reusable
//! across different modules and crates.
//!
//! ## Categories
//!
//! - **String Processing**: Common string manipulation and validation utilities
//! - **Path Utilities**: File path processing and validation helpers
//! - **Serialization Helpers**: Utilities for advanced serialization scenarios
//! - **Validation Helpers**: Common validation functions and patterns
//! - **Error Utilities**: Error creation and context management helpers
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! - Functions should be pure and side-effect free where possible
//! - All functions should be well-documented with clear examples
//! - Functions should handle edge cases gracefully with proper error types
//! - Performance should be considered for frequently-used utilities
//!
//! ## Future Expansion
//!
//! This module will be populated with common utility functions extracted from
//! the existing codebase during the dependency refactoring process. Functions
//! that are duplicated across multiple crates will be centralized here to
//! eliminate redundancy and ensure consistent behavior.
