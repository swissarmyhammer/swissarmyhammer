/**
 * Architectural guard: the three editor drill-in commands are DEFINED only by
 * the `ui-commands` builtin plugin — no client-built `CommandDef` in the
 * webview may define `filter_editor.drillIn`, `ui.ai-panel.composer.drillIn`,
 * or `ui.ai-panel.elicitation.field.drillIn` (including the retired per-field
 * minted form `ui.ai-panel.elicitation.field.drillIn:{key}`).
 *
 * Card E of the ui-command-cleanup project moved the drill-in definitions
 * (id / name / keys / scope) out of `perspective-tab-bar.tsx`,
 * `ai-prompt-composer.tsx`, and `ai-elements/elicitation.tsx` into
 * `builtin/plugins/ui-commands/index.ts` (`UI_SURFACE_COMMANDS`). The React
 * tree's only remaining role is BEHAVIOR: each editor surface registers a
 * webview-bus handler for its id while spatial focus is within its subtree
 * (`useFocusedWebviewCommandHandlers`). A drill-in `CommandDef` reappearing
 * anywhere in `src/` would re-split the ownership this card unified.
 *
 * The structural smell is an object-literal `id:` property holding one of the
 * drill-in ids — the shape every `CommandDef` construction uses, in any quote
 * style including a template literal (the retired elicitation def minted its
 * id as `` `ui.ai-panel.elicitation.field.drillIn:${key}` ``; see
 * `@/test/plugin-owned-guard`). Bus registrations pass the id as a bare call
 * argument / record key, never as an `id:` property, so
 * handler-registration sites do not trip the scan.
 *
 * As with `grid-commands.plugin-owned.node.test.ts`, the detector is
 * unit-proven against known-good and known-bad source below so the directory
 * scan is trustworthy.
