//! App-wide bootstrap of the in-process MCP servers + command service.
//!
//! Called once during `AppState` construction (after `ui_state` and the
//! window shell are built but before plugin discovery), this helper
//! exposes the 5 MCP modules (`store`, `entity`, `ui_state`, `window`,
//! `focus`) the builtin command plugins will activate, and installs the
//! `commands` module with the production store-backed transaction seam.
//! The returned `Arc<CommandService>` is held by `AppState` so the
//! Tauri `dispatch_command` handler can route through it directly.
//!
//! ## Multi-board routing
//!
//! The `store` and `entity` servers use task-local resolvers
//! ([`task_local_store_resolver`] /
//! [`swissarmyhammer_entity_mcp::server::task_local_resolver`]) so a
//! single exposed module routes per-call to whichever board is scoped
//! on the current `tokio` task — the dispatcher's
//! `scope_store_context` + `scope_entity_board_services` set those
//! task-locals around the `service.dispatch(...)` call. The
//! `ui_state` / `window` / `focus` modules are app-wide and take their
//! single shared context at construction.
