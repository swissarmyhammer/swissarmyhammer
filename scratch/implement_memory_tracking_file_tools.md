# Implement real memory tracking for file tools

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-tools/tests/file_tools_integration_tests.rs:62,69`

## Current State
```rust
// For now, we'll simulate memory tracking
```

## Description
File tools tests currently simulate memory tracking instead of implementing real memory tracking. This should be properly implemented to ensure file operations don't cause memory issues.

## Requirements
- Implement actual memory usage tracking during file operations
- Monitor memory consumption for read/write/edit operations
- Set appropriate memory limits and warnings
- Add tests for memory-intensive scenarios
- Handle out-of-memory conditions gracefully

## Use Cases
- Preventing memory exhaustion with large files
- Resource management in long-running processes
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Impact
Cannot accurately test or prevent memory issues in file operations.
