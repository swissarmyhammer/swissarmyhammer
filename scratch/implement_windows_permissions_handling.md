# Implement proper Windows permissions handling

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-common/src/fs_utils.rs:41`

## Current State
```rust
// Windows doesn't use octal permissions, so we return a placeholder
```

## Description
File system utilities return placeholder permissions on Windows. Proper Windows permission handling should be implemented using Windows ACLs.

## Requirements
- Implement Windows ACL reading
- Map Windows permissions to cross-platform representation
- Handle common permission scenarios (read, write, execute)
- Add platform-specific tests
- Document Windows permission model differences
- Consider using existing crates for ACL handling

## Platform Considerations
- Unix: octal permissions (rwxrwxrwx)
- Windows: ACLs (more complex inheritance model)
- Need consistent cross-platform API

## Impact
Cannot accurately check or set file permissions on Windows.
