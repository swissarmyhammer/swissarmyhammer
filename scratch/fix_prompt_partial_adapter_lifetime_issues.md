# Fix lifetime issues in prompt partial adapter

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-prompts/src/prompt_partial_adapter.rs:89`

## Current State
```rust
// Return empty slice for now to avoid lifetime issues
```

## Description
The prompt partial adapter returns an empty slice to avoid lifetime issues. This is a workaround that should be properly fixed by resolving the underlying lifetime problems.

## Requirements
- Analyze and fix lifetime issues in partial adapter
- Ensure proper ownership and borrowing
- Return actual data instead of empty slice
- Add tests to verify correct behavior
- Document lifetime requirements

## Impact
Partial adapter not functioning correctly, returning empty data.
