# Implement template context sync-back mechanism

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-workflow/src/template_context.rs:314`

## Current State
```rust
// For now, we'll be conservative and not sync back to avoid complications
```

## Description
Template context currently doesn't sync variables back to avoid complications. This conservative approach should be replaced with a proper sync-back mechanism when safe and appropriate.

## Requirements
- Design safe sync-back mechanism for template variables
- Identify scenarios where sync-back is appropriate
- Implement change tracking and conflict resolution
- Add validation to prevent unsafe modifications
- Add tests for sync-back scenarios
- Document sync-back behavior

## Use Cases
- Bidirectional variable flow in workflows
- Capturing results from template evaluation
- Dynamic variable updates

## Considerations
- Security: prevent variable injection
- Performance: minimize unnecessary syncs
- Consistency: handle concurrent modifications
