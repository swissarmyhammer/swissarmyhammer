# Implement hierarchy building logic in outline module

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-outline/src/hierarchy/mod.rs:20`

## Current State
```rust
// TODO: Implement hierarchy building logic
```

## Description
The hierarchy building functionality is currently a placeholder implementation. This should construct a proper hierarchical tree of code symbols (classes containing methods, modules containing functions, etc.).

## Requirements
- Build proper parent-child relationships between symbols
- Handle nested structures (classes in modules, methods in classes, etc.)
- Support all symbol types defined in the outline system
- Preserve source location information
