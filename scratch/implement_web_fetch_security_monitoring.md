# Implement comprehensive security monitoring for web fetch

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-tools/src/mcp/tools/web_fetch/security.rs:350`

## Current State
```rust
// For now, we rely on structured logging
```

## Description
Web fetch security currently only relies on structured logging. Comprehensive security monitoring should be implemented to track and prevent potential security issues.

## Requirements
- Implement security event tracking
- Monitor for SSRF attempts
- Track suspicious URL patterns
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Security metrics and alerting
- Audit log for security-relevant events
- Integration with security scanning tools
- Add tests for security scenarios

## Security Considerations
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- DNS rebinding attacks
- Time-of-check to time-of-use issues
- URL parsing vulnerabilities

## Impact
Limited visibility into potential security issues and attack attempts.
