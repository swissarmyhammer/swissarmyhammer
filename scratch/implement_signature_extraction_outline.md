# Implement signature extraction logic in outline module

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-outline/src/signature/mod.rs:19`

## Current State
```rust
// TODO: Implement signature extraction logic
```

## Description
The signature extraction functionality is currently unimplemented. This feature should extract function/method signatures from source code for display in outlines.

## Requirements
- Extract function signatures (parameters, return types)
- Extract method signatures from classes/traits
- Support multiple languages (Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Dart)
- Handle edge cases (async functions, generics, etc.)

## Related
This is part of the outline generation system and should work with the hierarchy building logic.
