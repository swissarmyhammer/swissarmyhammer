# Re-implement search term filtering with proper API

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-cli/src/list.rs:55`

## Current State
```rust
// Remove search term filtering for now - fix API later
```

## Description
Search term filtering was removed temporarily due to API issues. This functionality should be restored once the API is properly designed.

## Requirements
- Design proper API for search term filtering
- Re-implement the filtering functionality
- Add tests for various search patterns
- Update documentation

## Impact
Users cannot currently filter lists by search terms, reducing usability.
