# Implement language-specific symbol extractors

## Locations
- `swissarmyhammer-outline/src/extractors/python.rs:1` - Python-specific symbol extractor (placeholder)
- `swissarmyhammer-outline/src/extractors/javascript.rs:1` - JavaScript-specific symbol extractor (placeholder)
- `swissarmyhammer-outline/src/extractors/rust.rs:1` - Rust-specific symbol extractor (placeholder)
- `swissarmyhammer-outline/src/extractors/typescript.rs:1` - TypeScript-specific symbol extractor (placeholder)
- `swissarmyhammer-outline/src/extractors/dart.rs:1` - Dart-specific symbol extractor (placeholder)

## Current State
All language-specific extractors are marked as placeholders in `swissarmyhammer-outline/src/extractors/mod.rs:6`:
```rust
// Note: These extractors are placeholders and need full implementation
```

## Description
Currently, the outline system has placeholder implementations for language-specific symbol extraction. These need to be properly implemented to provide accurate code analysis for each supported language.

## Requirements
- Implement Python extractor (classes, functions, methods, imports)
- Implement JavaScript extractor (classes, functions, modules)
- Implement Rust extractor (structs, enums, functions, traits, modules)
- Implement TypeScript extractor (classes, interfaces, types, functions)
- Implement Dart extractor (classes, functions, constructors)
- Use Tree-sitter for accurate parsing
- Extract relevant metadata (documentation, signatures, etc.)

## Related
Depends on hierarchy building and signature extraction implementations.
