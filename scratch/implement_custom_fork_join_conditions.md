# Implement custom conditions in fork-join executor

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-workflow/src/executor/fork_join.rs:382`

## Current State
```rust
_ => false, // Skip custom conditions for now
```

## Description
The fork-join executor currently skips custom conditions and only handles basic condition types. Custom conditions should be implemented to allow more sophisticated branching logic.

## Requirements
- Define what "custom conditions" means in this context
- Implement evaluation logic for custom conditions
- Add tests for various custom condition scenarios
- Document the custom condition syntax/API
- Ensure security (no arbitrary code execution)

## Impact
Limits flexibility in complex workflow branching scenarios.
