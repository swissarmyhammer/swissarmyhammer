//! Pluggable navigation strategy and the default Android-style beam
//! search.
//!
//! [`NavStrategy`] abstracts the algorithm that picks the next focus
//! target given the current registry state, the currently focused
//! [`FullyQualifiedMoniker`] paired with its [`SegmentMoniker`], and
//! the requested [`Direction`]. Consumers that want the default
//! behavior use [`BeamNavStrategy`]; tests and specialised layouts can
//! swap in a custom impl without touching [`SpatialState`].
//!
//! # No-silent-dropout contract
//!
//! Nav and drill APIs always return a [`FullyQualifiedMoniker`]. "No
//! motion possible" is communicated by returning the focused entry's
//! own FQM — the React side detects "stay put" by comparing the
//! returned FQM to the previous focused FQM. Torn state (unknown FQM)
//! emits `tracing::error!` and echoes the input FQM so the call site
//! has a valid result. There is no `Option` or `Result` on these APIs;
//! silence is impossible.
//!
//! Two principles distinguish the two non-motion paths:
//!
//! - **No motion → return focused FQM (no trace).** A semantic
//!   "stay put" — wall override, focused at the visual edge of the
//!   layer with an empty Direction-D half-plane, leaf with no children.
//!   The kernel returns the focused entry's own FQM. Observable: focus
//!   stays where it was, no `null` blip on the React side, no log
//!   noise.
//! - **Torn state → trace error AND echo input.** A genuine error —
//!   unknown FQM passed in. The kernel emits `tracing::error!` with
//!   the operation, the relevant FQM(s), and the FQM being echoed
//!   back, then returns the input FQM so the call site has a valid
//!   value. User-observable behavior is identical to the "no motion"
//!   case (focus stays put), but ops / devs can chase the error in
//!   logs.
//!
//! The trait returns a [`FullyQualifiedMoniker`] — the canonical
//! identity. Callers that need the relative segment (for human-readable
//! logs or local-only display) read it from the registry by FQM.
//!
//! # Cardinal navigation — geometric pick (keyboard-as-mouse)
//!
//! Cardinal nav for [`Direction::Up`], [`Direction::Down`],
//! [`Direction::Left`], and [`Direction::Right`] is **purely
//! geometric**. Pressing an arrow key picks the registered scope (leaf
//! or zone, in the same `layer_fq`) whose rect minimises the Android
//! beam score (`13 * major² + minor²`) across ALL registered scopes in
//! the layer that:
//!
//! 1. Pass the **strict half-plane test** for D — the candidate's
//!    leading edge in the reverse direction is past the focused entry's
//!    leading edge in D. For `Down`: `cand.top >= from.bottom`. This
//!    filters out candidates that are not strictly in the half-plane,
//!    including containing parent zones.
//! 2. Pass the **in-beam test** for D — the candidate overlaps `from`
//!    on the cross axis (horizontal overlap for `Up`/`Down`, vertical
//!    overlap for `Left`/`Right`).
//! 3. Are not the focused entry itself.
//!
//! No structural filtering — `parent_zone` and `is_zone` are tie-breakers
//! and observability only.
//!
//! ## Tie-break: leaves over zones
//!
//! When two candidates have equal beam scores, **leaves win over
//! zones**. This ensures that when the geometric pick would land
//! equally on a `showFocusBar=false` container and an inner leaf, the
//! user sees the focus indicator paint on the leaf rather than the
//! invisible container.
//!
//! ## When the half-plane is empty
//!
//! If no candidate passes the strict half-plane and in-beam tests, the
//! focused entry is at the visual edge of the layer in direction D.
//! The kernel returns the focused FQM (stay-put), per the
//! no-silent-dropout invariant.
//!
//! # Why geometric (and not structural)
//!
//! The kernel's prior algorithm ran an iter-0 / iter-1 / drill-out
//! cascade keyed on the focused entry's `parent_zone`. That cascade
//! lost the user's mental model — "the visually-nearest thing in
//! direction D" — whenever the visual neighbor lived in a different
//! sub-tree. Symptoms included `target=None`, `scope_chain=["engine"]`,
//! and focus collapsing to the layer root when pressing `Left` from the
//! leftmost perspective tab or `Up` from a board column. The geometric
//! pick replaces that cascade with a single layer-wide search, fixing
//! the cross-zone bug class by construction.
//!
//! See `swissarmyhammer-focus/README.md` for the prose contract and
//! `tests/cross_zone_geometric_nav.rs` for the four cross-zone
//! regression tests.
//!
//! # First / Last
//!
//! [`Direction::First`] and [`Direction::Last`] focus the
//! **focused scope's children**, not its siblings. (The deprecated
//! `Direction::RowStart` / `Direction::RowEnd` aliases route through
//! the same path and are scheduled for removal — see the variant
//! docs in `crate::types`.)
//!
//! - **First child** = the child whose rect is topmost; ties broken by
//!   leftmost.
//! - **Last child** = the child whose rect is bottommost; ties broken
//!   by rightmost.
//! - **Children** = registered scopes whose `parent_zone` is the
//!   focused scope's FQM. Kind is **not** a filter — leaves and
//!   sub-zones are equally eligible children.
//!
//! On a focused leaf (no children) both ops return the focused FQM
//! (semantic no-op, no log noise) per the no-silent-dropout contract.
//!
//! `Direction::First` shares its result with
//! [`SpatialRegistry::drill_in`]'s cold-start fallback when the
//! focused zone has no `last_focused` memory — both pick the
//! topmost-then-leftmost child via the shared
//! [`crate::registry::first_child_by_top_left`] helper, so divergence
//! is structurally impossible. The
//! `first_matches_drill_in_first_child_fallback` test is the
//! behavioural backstop on that contract. The two ops differ only in
//! the key binding (Home vs Enter) and the React-side editor-focus
//! extension on Enter that `nav.first` does not get.
//!
//! Override (rule 0) still runs first — the focused scope's
//! per-direction `overrides` map short-circuits the children-of-focused
//! pick entirely.
//!
//! See `swissarmyhammer-focus/README.md` → `## First / Last` for the
//! prose contract.
