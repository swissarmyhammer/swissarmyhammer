Execute and manage workflows with support for starting new runs and resuming existing ones.
Workflows are defined as state machines that can execute actions and tools including Claude commands.

Basic usage:
  swissarmyhammer flow run my-workflow           # Start new workflow
  swissarmyhammer flow resume <run_id>           # Resume paused workflow
  swissarmyhammer flow list                      # List available workflows
  swissarmyhammer flow status <run_id>           # Check run status
  swissarmyhammer flow logs <run_id>             # View execution logs

Workflow execution:
  --vars key=value                               # Pass initial variables
  --interactive                                  # Step-by-step execution
  --dry-run                                      # Show execution plan
  --timeout 60s                                  # Set execution timeout

Examples:
  swissarmyhammer flow run code-review --vars file=main.rs
  swissarmyhammer flow run deploy --dry-run
  swissarmyhammer flow resume a1b2c3d4 --interactive
  swissarmyhammer flow list --format json
  swissarmyhammer flow status a1b2c3d4 --watch
