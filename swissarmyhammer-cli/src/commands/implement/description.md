Execute the implement workflow to autonomously work through and resolve all pending issues.
This is a convenience command equivalent to 'sah flow run implement'.

The implement workflow will:
• Check for pending issues in the ./issues directory
• Work through each issue systematically  
• Continue until all issues are resolved
• Provide status updates throughout the process

USAGE:
  swissarmyhammer implement

This command provides:
• Consistency with other top-level workflow commands like 'sah plan'
• Convenient shortcut for the common implement workflow
• Autonomous issue resolution without manual intervention
• Integration with existing workflow infrastructure

EXAMPLES:
  # Run the implement workflow
  swissarmyhammer implement
  
  # Run with verbose output for debugging
  swissarmyhammer --verbose implement
  
  # Run in quiet mode showing only errors
  swissarmyhammer --quiet implement

WORKFLOW DETAILS:
The implement workflow performs the following steps:
1. Checks if all issues are complete
2. If not complete, runs the 'do_issue' workflow on the next issue
3. Repeats until all issues are resolved
4. Provides completion confirmation

For more control over workflow execution, use:
  swissarmyhammer flow run implement --interactive
  swissarmyhammer flow run implement --dry-run

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If implementation fails:
• Check that ./issues directory exists and contains valid issues
• Ensure you have proper permissions to modify issue files
• Review workflow logs for specific error details
• Use --verbose flag for detailed execution information
• Verify the implement workflow exists in builtin workflows
