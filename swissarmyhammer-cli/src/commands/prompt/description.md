Manage and test prompts with built-in, user, and local template support.

Prompts are Liquid templates that can be rendered with variables to generate text output.
Use prompts for code reviews, planning, documentation, and other templated text generation.

Available prompt sources:
- Built-in prompts (shipped with the tool)
- User prompts (~/.swissarmyhammer/prompts/)
- Local prompts (./.swissarmyhammer/prompts/)

Use 'sah prompt list' to see all available prompts.
Use 'sah prompt test' to interactively test prompts with sample data.
