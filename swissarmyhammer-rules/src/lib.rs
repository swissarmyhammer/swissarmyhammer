//! # SwissArmyHammer Rules Domain Crate
//!
//! This crate provides rule management functionality for SwissArmyHammer,
//! including loading, filtering, and checking rules with template integration.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Rule Management**: Load and organize rules from various sources
//! - **Template Integration**: Uses swissarmyhammer-templating for rendering
//! - **Filtering**: Advanced filtering capabilities for rule selection
//! - **Resolution**: Hierarchical rule loading with precedence rules
