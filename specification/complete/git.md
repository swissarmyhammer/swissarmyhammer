# Git Integration Modernization: Shell to git2-rs Migration

## Overview

Replace current shell-based git command execution with native Rust git operations using the git2-rs crate to improve performance, reliability, and error handling.

## Current State Analysis

### Shell-based Git Usage
- Git commands executed via shell/bash tools
- String parsing of git output
- Error handling through exit codes and stderr parsing
- Platform-dependent command formatting
- Subprocess overhead for each git operation

### Identified Pain Points
- Inconsistent error messages across platforms
- Performance overhead from subprocess creation
- String parsing fragility
- Limited control over git operations
- Potential security concerns with shell injection

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment and Foundation
1. **Audit Current Git Usage**
   - Search codebase for shell git commands
   - Document all git operations currently performed
   - Identify usage patterns and frequencies
   - Map shell commands to git2-rs equivalents

2. **Dependency Integration**
   - Add git2 crate to Cargo.toml
   - Evaluate version compatibility requirements
   - Assess impact on build size and compilation time

### Phase 2: Core Git Operations
1. **Repository Operations**
   - Repository initialization and opening
   - Working directory and .git detection
   - Repository state querying

2. **Status and Diff Operations**
   - `git status` → `Repository::statuses()`
   - `git diff` → `Repository::diff_*()` methods
   - Working tree vs index comparisons
   - Staged vs unstaged change detection

3. **Branch Operations**
   - Current branch detection
   - Branch listing and creation
   - Branch switching and deletion
   - Remote branch tracking

### Phase 3: Commit and History Operations
1. **Commit Operations**
   - Staging files (`git add`)
   - Creating commits with metadata
   - Author and committer information handling
   - Commit message formatting

2. **History Operations**
   - Commit log retrieval
   - Commit traversal and filtering
   - Blame operations
   - Tag operations

### Phase 4: Remote Operations
1. **Remote Management**
   - Remote URL configuration
   - Fetch operations
   - Push operations with authentication
   - Pull request workflow support

2. **Authentication Handling**
   - SSH key authentication
   - Token-based authentication
   - Credential caching and storage

### Phase 5: Advanced Operations
1. **Merge and Rebase**
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Interactive operations
   - Cherry-pick operations

2. **Hooks and Configuration**
   - Git hooks integration
   - Repository configuration management
   - Global git configuration access

## Implementation Strategy

### API Design Principles
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for git object safety
- **Error Handling**: Use Result types for all fallible operations
- **Performance**: Minimize allocations and unnecessary operations
- **Consistency**: Uniform error types and operation patterns

### Proposed Module Structure
```
src/git/
├── mod.rs              # Public API and re-exports
├── repository.rs       # Repository operations
├── status.rs          # Status and diff operations
├── branch.rs          # Branch management
├── commit.rs          # Commit operations
├── remote.rs          # Remote operations
├── auth.rs            # Authentication handling
└── error.rs           # Git-specific error types
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Custom error types wrapping git2::Error
- Structured error information for common scenarios
- Conversion from git2 errors to application-specific errors
- Consistent error reporting across all git operations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual git operations
- Integration tests with real repositories
- Mock repository testing for edge cases
- Performance benchmarks comparing shell vs native

## Benefits Expected

### Performance Improvements
- Eliminate subprocess creation overhead
- Reduce string parsing and allocation
- Direct memory access to git objects
- Batch operations where possible

### Reliability Improvements
- Type-safe git operations
- Consistent error handling across platforms
- Reduced dependency on external git binary
- Better error context and debugging information

### Maintainability Improvements
- Centralized git logic in dedicated modules
- Testable git operations without shell dependencies
- Consistent API across all git functionality
- Easier to extend with new git features

## Risk Mitigation

### Compatibility Risks
- Test across different git repository formats
- Ensure compatibility with existing workflows
- Validate with various git hosting providers

### Migration Risks
- Phased migration to allow rollback
- Comprehensive testing before removing shell commands
- Feature parity validation between implementations

### Performance Risks
- Benchmark critical operations
- Memory usage monitoring during migration
- Optimization of hot paths identified through profiling

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Parity**: All current git operations work identically
2. **Performance Gain**: Measurable improvement in git operation speed
3. **Error Quality**: Better error messages and debugging information
4. **Code Quality**: Reduced complexity in git-related code paths
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for all git operations
