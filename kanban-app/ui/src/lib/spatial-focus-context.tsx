/**
 * Spatial focus claim registry — per-window, event-driven.
 *
 * Mirrors the Rust-side `SpatialState` in `swissarmyhammer-kanban/src/focus/state.rs`.
 * Rust owns the focused-key map (per `WindowLabel`); the React side keeps a
 * `Map<SpatialKey, (focused: boolean) => void>` and a single global
 * `focus-changed` event listener that dispatches `false` to the previously
 * focused key's callback and `true` to the newly focused key's.
 *
 * Each Tauri window has its own React tree and therefore its own claim
 * registry, so a `focus-changed` event for another window's key is a
 * silent no-op here — the lookup misses and nothing fires. We do not
 * filter on `window_label` because Tauri's emit-to-all behavior is
 * symmetric: every window receives every event, but only the window that
 * actually mounted the matching `<FocusScope>` will have a callback to
 * dispatch to.
 *
 * This file does **not** replace `entity-focus-context.tsx` — that
 * context still drives the moniker-keyed scope registry, command-scope
 * chain, and the legacy `setFocus` dispatch path. The claim registry is
 * an additional, opt-in layer that lets a `<FocusScope>` subscribe to its
 * own focus state by `SpatialKey` without re-rendering the whole tree.
